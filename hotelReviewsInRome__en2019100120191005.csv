0,"The rooms aren’t as big as they seemed in the pictures but there was enough space for two people. A few cobwebs in the highs and lows of the room, so in terms of cleanliness it wasn’t 4*. When showering the water went all over the floor, in puddles just outside the bathtub, I’m sure there was leak in the tub and the shower head was coming out the wall. The pressure of the shower was really good though.Breakfast was standard, but the staff were extremely helpful and pleasant.The location was good as we walked everywhere. It’s about 15/20 minutes from Trevi fountain and the Spanish steps, about 40 minutes to the Colosseum and about an hour from Vatican City. Advice is to pre-book all of these before reaching there.  Overall standard room, wouldn’t have paid as much as I had for the standard of it but we did go peak season. ","July 13, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

2,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at Hotel Romanico Palace. Rooms were charming, clean, well kept, and comfortable, as was the entire property. The staff was courteous, helpful, and eager to please guests. The location near beautiful Borghese Park is perfect with easy access to many of Rome's attractions. Nearby restaurants offered everything from sandwiches to elegant dinners with impeccable service and acceptable prices. I would be delighted to stay here again.","July 8, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

The staff were very helpful and whenever we needed anything, like towels, they would bring it up straight away. Our room was very spacious and the decor was wonderful.

7,Once entering the room it was lovely to see the effort. Rose petals were sprinkled on the bed. One thing which I found funny was the window that allowed everyone to see inside the bathroom. The decorations on the walls and ceiling also added to the italian experience. The hotel is in a really good position to bars and restaurants and also walking distance to some major tourist attractions. Would definitely recommend. ,"July 1, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

It smelled as if it were mold or mildew, but it was so strong it was a health concern. I shared my concern with the hotel, but there was no response. I realize the hotel is old, but this was unacceptable and needs to be attended to.","June 28, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

9,"Loved this hotel for our stay in Rome. We had a large group staying here and each room was unique with its own style. The front desk and concierge were great to accommodate us and give recommendations and directions. It was very clean and the breakfast overlooked the city. I had read different opinions about the breakfast, but we all thought it was great. There is a small bar and sitting area you can sit if waiting to join a group of just to sit and visit. Good location if you don't mind a short walk to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain area, or even the Termini train station.","June 28, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

10,"2 Queen beds, spacious room, lovely decor and large claw tub bath with shower. Ask for room 311!Our A/C kept us cool--a welcome relief after touring the Vatican and Roman Ruins all day!. Although we were not within walking distance of our tours, (a 55-min walk to the Vatican), we were able to get a cab in 5 minutes. We booked a private taxi to the airport in advance which was well worth it. Only a few dollars more compared to sharing a taxi. Disappointed that the hotel did not serve dinner, but we found a great authentic place a few blocks up the street that fit the bill. Reserve in advance! Breakfast on the 7th floor was included and well worth it! Delicious and the view with light jazz music helped set the tone for the day! We had to contend with a loud party going on across the street and could hear their music which didn't help us get to bed early as planned. It was on a week night, and it stopped at midnight so we got some sleep before departing the next morning. Overall, compared to other hotels, we enjoyed this stay!","June 25, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

11,"Very Nice Hotel, accommodations were great, staff was very accommodating and perfect location to restaurants and shopping. This was our 3rd and final Europe stop on a 10 day vacation to celebrate my 50th birthday and I was looking forward to a massage before flying back home. The shower was amazing and perfect after a long day of walking! However, I was a little dissappointed they did not have a spa as I thought they did. Also, I was happy they offered breakfast, but, selections were more on the continental side, would loved to have had an omelette option:-) All in alI, I would stay here again!","June 20, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

12,"Hotel Romanico Palace was booked for Rome on advice of my travel agent. Amount paid in advance. When we reached in our hotel and asked to check in. Staff at reception told me that we have some problem of no availability of room today so we arranged your room in other hotel and taxi will be arranged to that small hotel. I paid for 4 star hotel Romanico Palace and they don't care about reservations and sent us to other hotel with our all luggage. Because our booking was for 3 Nights so they said we will come tomorrow back and hotel will pay taxi rent also. Next morning we came back with our luggage in a taxi. Manager asked me about taxi receipt for promised rent while I have not taken so rent was not paid. Then he said room is not ready yet so deposite your luggage and go around Rome and will be back Afternoon. Bad experience of a 4 star hotel. Hotel rooms are excellently decorated and really nice. Hotel has no restaurant inside for lunch or dinner. No food serving in room. Only breakfast facility available with small range and bad service. Supply of food is slow. No fresh juices or coffee machine. Staff promised me to compensate of bothering with airport transportation but after check out said sorry no car is available so arranged for taxi and paid my rent myself. I travelled throughout Europe and stayed in eight hotels in different countries and cities in 18 days but this was only bitter experienced hotel during our tour. Rooms with no water, tea or coffee was available. Nice building hotel with beautiful capacious rooms and no ethics. ","June 18, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

20,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel romanico palace for 8 nights at the beginning of May for a birthday/ anniversary trip.Hotel romanico palace is that calm sanctuary that keeps you refreshed and ready to face your day with energy and excitement. All this with true welcome for their city of Rome. This trip was a year in the making, and I had decided on hotel romanico palace early on. About a week before our arrival, I began to get nervous and thought my expectations were too high for this Hotel . I worried for nothing! They delivered an amazing holiday experience. Hotel romanico palace goes above and beyond in the service experience. It is as if they wish to provide you with lifetime memories. For example, one night while chatting with Vincenzo (name hopefully spelled correctly) we mentioned our potential plans for the next day and he gave us some great suggestions. Later that evening he thought he may have given us misinformation, so research was done and we were updated in the morning! This is just one example of the genuine level of care and concern shown at hotel romanico palace. The location of Hotel cannot be beat - steps from via veneto and the decor and comfort of the rooms fit right in with the overall goal of an elegant sanctuary. I cannot wait until the next time!","May 28, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

24,"Very friendly Staff, decent size rooms and good location, but too many other averages to recommend it to others. Decor & fittings suit style of hotel, if a little worn in places, but generally OK. Although having no restaurant facility in the hotel is not a real problem, (as there are many good places to eat nearby), it does mean the breakfast buffet quality is poor for the supposed level of residence. High level of usage by tour operators means the foyer and other front areas become very busy on changeover days and queues for the 2 lifts, but also the tour operator guiders take over all the lounge/bar area for their talks etc. ","May 18, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

28,"After months of research my wife chose this location as our Roman home away from home. Checked in on Apr 27 and checked out on May 2.Our room had a sitting area, bathroom and bed area. We found the room very comfortable.Two minor issues with the room. The street noise and the shower/bathtub. The shower enclosure only covers half the tub. So the water spray can cause wet floors.Breakfast is served on the 7th floor. Each morning they served scrambled eggs and ham, along with yogurt, cheeses and lunch meat. Juices, coffee and tea. Milk, cereal, oatmeal. Finally they had a table with many pastries to choose from. A couple of mornings they ran out of scrambled eggs and it took them a while to replenish.One of our mornings we took a taxi to the Colosseum (12 euro). The other days we walked everywhere. Most of the big tourist stops were 15-20 minutes. We even walked to the Vatican for the papal audience (40 minutes).If we return to Rome we would stay at this hotel again.","May 12, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

We'd arrived so late I decided not to say anything, or ask to be changed rooms. But the smell was insane.

We were taken to our room and we were blown away. It was a suite with a lounge, bedroom and bathroom. There was a massive, super comfortable bed with spotlessly clean linen, a spacious bathroom that was also very clean and was equipped with toiletries and clean, soft towels. The decor is wonderful. The bar staff were so friendly and there was a wide range of drinks to choose from. Breakfast was abundant and with a great choice and served in the beautiful rooftop restaurant with amazing views to look any as you eat. It set us up for the day ahead.

There are a few negative comments on here about this hotel but I really can’t see where they are coming from. All I can think is some people will find fault wherever they go. Please don’t be put off by them. I will return to Rome and I will stay here again. Thank you for a wonderful visit.","April 12, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

44,"Upon arrival we were greeted. The lobby was clean and quiet. We arrived about 9am and check in was at 2 pm so the front desk associate agreed to hold our luggage in a locked a secured area. I asked if they can do an early check in because we had a tour schedule at 2pm and he told me to check back a little later. My daughter and I were able to walk from the hotel to the Colosseum. After a short tour and lunch we walked back to the hotel around 1:30pm and I asked about the early check in and the front desk person said no. I ask if there were any restrooms we could use to change and he said no. He stated that we would have to find a restroom somewhere. I was a bit disappointed because this was my first time in Rome and I didn’t know anywhere to go. So around 1:50 I asked if our room was ready and it still was a no. So needless to say I lost my money on our tour to the Vatican which was about $200USD. I was a little upset about it because they waited until exactly 2pm to check me in. I have never had an issue like this before in all my traveling. Overall the room was clean and the night staff was very helpful and friendlier than the day staff. The breakfast was AMAZING and the rooftop view was classic. Will I return, yes. Will I recommend this hotel, yes!! ","April 10, 2019","0    Hotel Romanico Palace

55,"So, to start - this hotel is absolutely gorgeous and has incredible vibes! The location itself is about 10 minutes from the train terminal by car, 20 minutes via taxi to the Vatican, and about a 15 minute walk to the Spanish Stairs. If you’re planning to arrive early, let the concierge know and they accommodate as best as they can. First stop, the rooftop bar for a complimentary glass of the bubbly (or coffee). However, I HIGHLY recommend Maurizio’s handcrafted Apple Fruit Martini . It’s seriously heavenly, plus he’s quite the gentleman so that’s a fun plus. The entire staff is extremely friendly, speak fluent English and welcome you with plenty of advice for local spots. And one thing - eat as much pasta and gelato as you can!

57,"This was our third stay at Hotel Artemide and it did not disappoint. We asked to stay in the same room as before, not remembering the room number ourselves, but sure enough the hotel came up trumps. The first time we stayed was 10 years ago, and then again 5 years ago. It says a lot when you recognise some of the staff from before. The hotel has been updated in that time and is very pleasant and relaxing. The location is very central and we walk to all the main tourist attractions from there.Upon arrival this time, we were greeted with a very warm welcome. Everyone speaks English. We were given a voucher to have a welcome drink on the roof top terrace. Always an enjoyable experience. We asked for a table to be booked for that evening and later in the week (for our anniversary). All sorted out for us as it was fully booked.When we were shown to our room, a bottle of red and some snacks were waiting for us along with a personalised Congratulations card. Breakfast is a buffet and is very comprehensive. Continental meats, cheese, sausages, eggs, bacon, fresh fruit etc. All the breads and pastries are from their own kitchen and every morning you are offered the “cake” of the day by the waiting staff, as well as bruschetta and cheese. Staff are very friendly and always eager to please.Rome is a fascinating city with lots of things to see and do and staying at Artemide is the icing on the cake. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay for a fourth time.","July 9, 2019","1    Hotel Artemide

The breakfast was the best I've ever had at a hotel. The rooftop restaurant is incredible. The spa is amazing. The AC in the room works fantastic (which is a plus for the hot summers in Rome).Look no further when searching for a hotel in Rome. Hotel Artemide creates an experience that lasts a lifetime.

This centrally located hotel is close to many of the most famous sites in Rome, including the Colosseum and Trevia Fountain, and there are numerous great restaurants within walking distance. The room was nice and immaculate, and the service during our 5-night stay was excellent.

70,"Our family of four (2 teen boys, ages 13 & 15) came to Rome for the first time having stayed here. It was glorious from the beginning to end for several reasons: 1) Great location - Central to everything, including walking distance to Trevi. 2) Unbelievable Staff - These people greeted us with smiles right when we checked in. As we were checking out, another staff asked if we needed our luggage held. He took the initiative. At breakfast, all staff asked if we wanted freshly made dessert or anything else. This brings me to the next topic...breakfast.3) Amazing breakfast buffet - Despite its 4-star classification (how could this not be a 5-star?), it’s breakfast was amazing. They had eggs, sausage, beans, smoked salmon...you name it. I looked forward to breakfast every morning. Even was willing to skip dinner for this breakfast. 4) Super fast and helpful concierge - Need I say more? Needed to change our train reservations. My husband went downstairs and Jess than 10 minutes later he was back up. Initially I thought that the concierge wasn’t there or able to help given how quickly he came back up. But it turns out that he was able to get it all resolved and taken care of that quickly. 5) Clean, clean, clean - this place was spotless. We stayed in Paris and experienced completely the opposite. The Paris hotel was an absolute dump despite its price and classification. This hotel was in stark contrast to what we had experienced there. America and the hotel industry internationally can learn a thing or two from the Italians. 6) Beds - The beds were absolutely heavenly. I did not realize how much I appreciate a firm bed until I stayed here. It was almost like a memory foam firm bed. I loved it and got the best night’s sleep. 7) Stocked bar - many of the hotels will charge you for taking one little creamer or a piece of candy from the hotel room. But not this one. Whatever was in the refrigerator was ours to keep for free. What hotel does that?Only issue that we had is that the shower door was too short. Whenever we took showers, because there wasn’t a sliding door, rather a short piece of glass that didn’t move, there was a ton of water that spilled out and sprayed out of it. Therefore leaving a huge mess. Would come back here in a heartbeat!! The BEST! And we’ve stayed at 5-star hotels before. ","June 18, 2019","1    Hotel Artemide

A short walk from the main Termini transportation station, we also walked to the Colosseum, and to the shopping on Via del Corso. Staff was really helpful on check-in and all really great the entire three days. Our basic double room (319) was small but efficient. Comfortable bed and sheets, very nice bathroom, really well lit, and the air conditioning worked great.

There is a spa one floor below (-1 with 0 being street level). Robes and slippers are provided in the room. As in many places in Europe, there are no wash clothes so throw some in when you pack.

I would encourage you to read that review for travel specifics about the Hotel Artemide. Everything is just as wonderful, if not better!For this review, I would like to focus on the extraordinary staff. I have vacationed at many wonderful resorts and I have received outstanding service at some of them, but in my opinion, no other place comes close to the level of service, professionalism, helpfulness, and cheerful attitude as exemplified by the very special staff of the Hotel Artemide! From check in to check out, everything is seamless. The front desk and foyer staff are exemplary, always attending to our needs almost before we can voice them. Whether it is making reservations or recommendations, calling for transportation, or helping with luggage and packages, they can be counted on 100%This same desire to please customers extends to the dining staff, both at the breakfast cafe and at the Ambrosia rooftop bar and restaurant. Staff members are quick to remember particular preferences and do everything possible to fulfill them. So wonderful to return late in the day and head to the rooftop for a relaxing cocktail and be greeted by Maurizio, Sami, or Lacra as if we were treasured friends.But what we loved most of all, was the playfulness and genuine friendliness that was extended that made it so much fun to interact with the various staff members. We have been thoroughly spoiled by the delightful Artemide staff, and can't wait to see them again on our next trip. Be sure to reserve early because, sadly for us guests, the word is out that this is the place to stay.","June 10, 2019","1    Hotel Artemide

82,"The location of this hotel was wonderful; very centrally located for everything that we wanted to see. We had 2 rooms for 4 adults. The rooms definitely had enough space and were very clean. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. Federica, at the front desk, answered all of our questions. She, always, had a smile on her face. Maurizio, the rooftop bartender, performed magic with his drinks. Not only were they delicious but they looked beautiful. Salvatore, in the breakfast room, greeted us pleasantly every morning. He remembered what we liked to drink with our breakfast - either Americano coffee or cappuccino. Salvatore even helped my son with a cleaner when he spilled something on his white shirt. The porters were very helpful with our luggage. Would highly recommend this hotel.","June 9, 2019","1    Hotel Artemide

83,"First off this was our first time in Italy. Traveling from New York. We had a room on the 6th floor and could still hear outside street noise, not a deal breaker but noticeable. Hotel location was appealing to me, close enough to walk to main Rome attractions but far enough to be off the main hustle and bustle Rome streets. Staff was very nice. Doormen and luggage porters to the staff in the breakfast room. Breakfast was included in our stay and we loved it! The staff was great and offered a large number of options for food, all top quality. The rooftop restaurant was also great! Nice staff, food was delicious and very reasonably priced. Room service ordered through this restaurant as well one night was just as good. The room itself was very small, large bed took up 95% of the room. TV and cable options were more then sufficient. Bathroom was great very large and clean. Amazing mini bar stocked daily free of charge was a nice bonus. Highly recommend as a home base when exploring Rome! ","June 7, 2019","1    Hotel Artemide

He really went above and beyond to help us on several occasions. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are spacious. The location is perfect - walking distance to most of the main sights.

86,"First time in Rome and what an amazing find the Artemide was. From the moment we arrived the service was amazing. We stayed for three nights, front desk staff were more than helpful, our room was immaculately clean, the room provided all toiletries, towels, robes and slippers were excellent quality, in room snacks/drinks are complimentary. There were facilities provided to make hot drinks in the room and there was also a room off the lobby providing 24 hour hot drinks.Breakfast was truly a delight, wonderfully presented, immaculately clean, the staff cooking and presenting the breakfast are very passionate and it shows. It was my wife’s birthday and on the morning she was presented with a wonderful fruit flan creation complete with a candle, which was a stunning surprise as we had not mentioned that it was her special day to anyone. Salvatore made each morning very special for us with his excellent customer service and his attention to detail. The breakfast restaurant was smoothly run and nothing was too much trouble, the staff were amazing. We also had a meal at the roof top restaurant, Ambrosia , which was a wonderful, beautifully presented three course evening meal. We received the same great customer service here to.The hotel is in a great location for getting to the main sights easily, also lots of shops and restaurants around the vicinity.We would definitely recommend this hotel and can’t wait to return.

87,"We stayed at the Hotel Artemide May 19-22 and enjoyed every moment. Upon arriving at the hotel from the airport we were greeted warmly by the front desk with a lovely upgrade to our room from a triple deluxe to a junior suite. Loved this welcome! They proceeded to top this wonderful service when they found out we had an early start time the next morning for a tour of the Vatican by providing us with breakfast goody bags so we wouldn’t go hungry. First impressions are important and they exceeded expectations. The porter assisted us with our luggage and showed us the amenities to our room. Since we received an upgraded room, he realized my daughter’s sofa bed was not ready and took it upon himself to notify housekeeping. Housekeeping arrived a few minutes later with bedding, towels and extra robe and slippers. Kudos to their staff for being so observant and friendly! The room was fabulous, we had 2 doors leading out to a balcony with a great view of Via Nazionale. Our daughter had her own tv, closet and charging area while we had a huge bed with our own charging areas and a tv. Pocket doors separated the two areas. The bathroom was a dream with beautiful lighting and marble. The shower stall and rain head was big and so soothing. The room was a lovely refuge after tours and shopping. Our daughter loved it so much she didn’t want to leave for the tours. We loved eating at Ambrosia restaurant, so much that we booked another visit on our last night in Rome. The food was a visual feast for the eyes and stomach. We would have licked the plates clean if we could!Location wise, the hotel was close to all the attractions save the Vatican where we chose to use a cab. The Colosseum was at the most a 15-20 minute walk and less for the Pantheon, Trevi fountain and Piazza Navona.Concierge services had great recommendations for dinner and we had a delicious time at Cotto. They also assisted us with booking a cab to the airport when it was time to go home. All questions and requests were always met with a smile and warmth that clearly showed the staff wanted to assist. We had a great time staying at Hotel Artemide. There is a reason clients voted them # 1. We will definitely come back to stay here again. Thank you!","June 4, 2019","1    Hotel Artemide

A combination of elegance and tasteful Italian décor set the mood for a wonderful end to our month long journey of Sicily and the Amalfi Coast.From the moment you arrive at this hotel you are greeted with excellent service, commencing with Sebastian and staff at reception, through to porters, cleaners, chefs, bar and restaurant personnel. In particular, the manager of the rooftop restaurant and trainee, Micaela, made our evenings most enjoyable. The chefs ensured our return each evening by producing delicious meals and by surprising us with extra touches, such as canapes, appetizers and desserts that seemed forever appearing.

Room was small but with ample space to unpack. The bed was wonderful and the bathroom was modern and spacious for spreading out toiletries. I was pleased to see all their shampoos etc were cruelty-Free. The rooftop bar and restaurant are first class. We went there on our final night and were treated to gourmet dining. Breakfast was also delicious with a huge array of choices and fresh homemade specialty dishes offered up to your table as well by a wandering waitress with a tray of goodies.

107,"The hotel is in a great location. Short walk from Rome Termini Station, 15 min walk to Trevi Fountain, Colosseum, and the Spanish Steps. Unfortunately it is not in the best area for restaurants and we found ourselves walking 20+ minutes to get to most of the highly reviewed restaurants. It is possible to walk to/from the Vatican as well, but that is 45 mins to an hour. If you aren’t concerned about access to trains, you might want to consider something a bit closer to the river. The hotel itself is quite nice. We have stayed in some bummer 4 star hotels in Europe and we were nicely surprised by Artemide. The rooms are nicely appointed and well maintained. Ours was a bit small but it was comfortable. Yes. The reviews are true. The mini bar is free and restocked daily. This is an incredible plus and saved us a substantial amount of pocket cash each day on water, sodas and light snacks. We had no view to speak of and missed being able to peer out our window at one of the city’s many sights. Breakfast is well done and I highly recommend a room rate that includes breakfast. There are plenty of options, both hot and cold, to choose from, and plenty of things to grab and stuff in you bag to snack on during the day. Staff were nice but really the hotel isn’t full-service with a dedicated concierge. They will try to help you book tours and can assist with major arrangements, but they lacked detailed local expertise on dining, drinking and entertainment. The spa is nice and has good facilities - sauna, steam room/Turkish bath, plunge pools, etc. I got a massage for a decent fee, and it was good, not great. However the massage fee did not include access to the spa and it was 30 euro to use the facilities on top of the 75 for the massage. Fortunately the front desk was honest about our booking which apparently included 1 free spa access per occupant, so the fee was waived on check out. The fitness center is tiny but has good modern equipment. No excuse for not working out here. Overall I would recommend this hotel. It is a solid 4 star performance for a solid 4 star property. A little extra attention here and there from the staff and a few more included extras and I might consider rating it a 4.5-5. The one thing going against it is value. The price we paid was high for what we got, both in terms of accommodations and service. We stayed in an exceptional 5 star property in Milano just prior to coming here, and by comparison Artemide was not a great value. ","May 13, 2019","1    Hotel Artemide

Prices for the accommodation vary from very reasonable (130 or 140 to 500 and more per night). We paid 160 excl city tax for a room in main building which we found very reasonable. One word of advice, if you like a quite room fo not take a room at the front as it can get noisy with the street performer till late. We weren't bothered in fact we liked it! .

I should state that staff were incredibly polite and were as helpful as possible in the circumstances. The hotel is also in a great location. Anyway, We booked a ‘superior’ room and the room that we were offered for our stay was room 101 on the first floor (although we’d requested a high floor at the time of booking). According to the booking.com portal ‘superior’ rooms were supposed to have a balcony but room 101 didn’t have one (we didn’t realise until arrival but only the higher floors actually have balconies!) - we were informed that this error was the fault of booking.com. We had to accept room 101 as there were no rooms available on higher floors until the next day (we were only staying for 3 nights). We entered room 101, there was an awful musty smell and the window was open. I complained about the smell and mentioned the suspicious open window - I was informed that apart from having the room re-cleaned nothing could be done and it was hotel policy to leave room windows open prior to occupancy. We accepted our lot as we were tired from travelling. We then discovered that although very warm outside the air conditioning didn’t work - we were informed that the air conditioning throughout the hotel hadn’t been ‘switched on’ as it was too early in the year and all rooms were the same. The bathroom in room 101 had a bath with integral shower arrangement - my wife tried tried to run a bath but only the shower worked. We complained - a maintenance man arrived and informed us that the bath tap was broken and he could leave us with either the bath or shower working (not both). We chose the bath. Again, my wife tried to run a bath and the dirtiest brown liquid spurted out (and with ‘bits’ in it). I left this coloured water in the bath and went to reception. The reception manager came to take a look and was also taken aback by the colour of the water. He went away to speak to the hotel manager and offered us a 50% discount for our first night’s stay. Being on the first floor and with the window open due to no air conditioning, it was a very noisy first night and difficult to sleep (it was a Saturday). One other thing (and just an aside really) - some time the next morning, looking up at the ceiling, I noticed that the smoke alarm had been covered by a plastic bag. The next day we were moved to a newly refurbished room (414) - it had its own terrace and this room was absolutely delightful (the type of room we thought that we’d booked initially). Upon entering, we found the windows closed and that the air conditioning worked. If you are thinking of booking this hotel I would advise asking for a confirmed room number and at the very least whether or not the room is refurbished - if the hotel cannot confirm these details then stay elsewhere. A discount of 50% for one night may sound reasonable until you factor in that one third of our stay was made unpleasant by this hotel’s performance and the cost of one third of our trip was considerably more than the discount we enjoyed.","April 22, 2019","2    Condotti Hotel

Do your research and stay some place nicer and enjoy Rome.The customer service was horrible. As we were checking out at 4am, we thought we'd settle the city tax bill the night before. They wanted the city tax paid in cash and had no change! The young guy behind the desk was so rude about it...quote ""what do you want me to do about it"" We had to go to nearby restaurants and beg them to break a note for us so we could pay the guy at reception the city tax in the exact amount.We were checked into a room that had a broken window, the window wouldn't actually close.

122,"We stayed in the annex building in Via del Corso. Positive: Great location, a bit noisy during the day and early evening though due to numerous shoppers. At night it was perfectly quiet. Room looked relatively new and comfy. Cleaning was good. We had electric kettle, little fridge and complimentary snacks + tea/coffee, whick was really nice. They also had extra brankets.Negative: The room was cold. We were freezing at night. Air conditioner was pre-programmed on a certain regimen and the sign said not to change it. Conditioner display was malfunctioning and not always allowed us to adjust the temperature (sometimes we managed to increase it, sometimes didn't). As a result we caught a cold..On the day of check-out our cards just got blocked and we could not get inside our room where all our luggage was. Since this building has not staff on duty - it is really not very customer oriented. Besides I wish they told us about possible blocking in advance..Finally, at the check-out although staff was nice, they pushed us really hard to leave excellent review (like, ""when you get the questionnaire, put only 5 stars on every question""). That was weird. I mean, if you want excellent reviews - make your customers' stay excellent. Also you can just ask your customers in person what they liked and what they didn't ))","January 16, 2019","2    Condotti Hotel

129,"My positive experience with the hotel began as soon as my reservation was made. I had a few changes prior to arrival and they were responsive by email and very accommodating. We also asked at the last minute for our two rooms to be next door and were lucky they were able to accommodate. The attitude was friendly, lighthearted, and helpful. The location was ideal for us. Central, busy street, walkable to most of our preferred sites. It was a two minute walk to the Spanish Steps. The room met our necessities and was comfortable. Air condition and water pressure were strong. Rooms were clean, and included a safe, slippers, extra pillow and blanket, soap, shower cap, cups, coffee machines, biscuits. We were in the other building (not the main building where you check in) and being unfamiliar with the area I was worried what that meant. I worried for nothing. It was around the corner on a Main Street, and felt like we had an apartment in Rome as opposed to a hotel room because there is no hotel lobby. But if you need anyone, the main lobby was a 30 second walk around the corner. The breakfast was good; if you stay in the annex building its additional and if you are in main building it's included. It was good, no complaints. If you don't eat much for breakfast, I'd just buy coffee and a pastry at a nearby cafe for less and get moving. We fell in love with Rome on this trip and plan to come back someday. We would 100% stay at Hotel Condotti again and will recommend to friends.

132,"As much as I would love to give this historical hotel 5 Stars, I did have issues with the size of the room and their breakfast. Room Size -1 Star– Very cramped. Ignore the pictures on this website.The Spanish Step are NOT down the street from the hotel. They're close, but more like 2-3 blocks away. I rented the ‘double standard’ room, er, closet.. There was about a 2 foot space around the perimeter of the bed, hardly any space to open a suitcase. The bath was small, but large enough for 2 people. Water pressure (shower) was adequate. Bed was a bit firm.My issue was that I specifically requested a room in their annex (I never did find out where the annex was). According to their website, the rooms in the annex are suppose to be slightly larger, but when I questioned the hotel about the different size rooms, they insisted all rooms, whether in main hotel or annex, were the same size.Then why does the web site specify the annex was larger?My second issue was their breakfast. They quoted me 14 Euros for the breakfast, and believe me, it wasn’t worth it. Nothing hot, mostly cheese, some meat and rolls. Major ripoff, so go to a nearby pastry shop instead.For each of my issues, I deducted one star on the rating. I will give a 5 Star rating to Angelo at the front desk. Speaks great English and knows the best restaurants in the neighborhood. Super nice and professional..","August 29, 2018","2    Condotti Hotel

133,"I booked at Condotti for 2 nights (1 night on our arrival to Rome and the second one after 1 week). When we arrived at Condotti hotel, the receptionist said that there was a problem with our room because of the rain and that he will take us to a better hotel (a four star hotel)... without saying sorry, without asking us if we were ok with that, without even asking us if we prefer a refund... they didn’t even sent us a mail to inform us about the situation. They waited until we arrived at the hotel at night (at 11:00 pm) and they informed us about the problem. The guy accompanied us to the other hotel, it was a terrible hotel (Hotel El Corso) very old and dirty. It was not a four stars hotel as he said, it was a 3 stars hotel but for me this hotel doesn’t deserve a single star. It was a very bad experience for us. Don’t book at Condotti hotel because they are liars. You book online at Condotti then when you arrive to the hotel, they take you to an annex bldg or to another hotel and tell you that they have a problem with your room. They did it to us twice this month. When we arrived for our second night at Condotti hotel, the receptionist said that the hotel was full and that we will take us to annex bldg that is part of the hotel also. In fact our room was not in annex bldg as he said, it was about 8 min walking from Condotti hotel, and it was in another hotel (Style inn hotel) in Via del Corso. When I said to the receptionist that I didn’t want to go to another hotel, he said that our room was not refundable.Don’t book at this hotel because they will not give you a room in the hotel, they will take you to another hotel.

It's the only stop so no need to worry about where to get off. From there you can either walk(roughly 40minutes), taxi(around €15), take another bus or get the metro.

The location is marvellous - a short taxi ride from Roma Termini station (it should cost you around 12 Euro if the meter is on, don't let the cab drivers quote you a higher amount!), and you are placed right in the middle of everything - the glorious shops, beautiful cafes and bars, Piazza's and Spanish steps with Trevi Fountain around the corner.

This was disappointing and the breakfast replacement offered in that building was coffee and dull plastic wrapped cake. Not the best start to the day! The air conditioning was impossible to alter - a note saying it was set to match the season: a huge assumption that everybody likes their room at the Same temperature! I don’t. The water in the shower was not always piping hot and other guests in the block could be heard showering and this also sometimes caused gurgling in the basin.

It was a real feature of the room with glass windows but cleverly designed. We loved the massive bath and great shower. The room was very clean and cleaned daily with new towels etc which was lovely. As we were checking out, Vlad at reception offered us a complimentary breakfast which was wonderful as breakfast was not included in our package. This was a lovely touch as we were leaving very early (7.30am) for a coliseum tour. All staff were extremely helpful and friendly during our stay. Would not hesitate recommending this hotel and would return. Central location and quiet little street Trastevere area is much cheaper to eat in that those places around the hotel. It’s a bit of a walk but has a nice local feel and plenty of choice for food and drink! Check out bar san calisto for an authentic and very affordable night out Also enjoyed le piccolo wine bar if you’re looking for an authentic feel. ","April 5, 2018","2    Condotti Hotel

150,"Hi, we are staying at this hotel near the Spanish steps. Its a very good location. Breakfast is typical and nice with both continental and hot and cold items. The main hotel is a bit old style and our room needs updating. The video playing in the bf room depicts room furnishing that are selected with elegance (I think is the wording). its also marketing. The linens need to be updated, as well as hard pillows and carpeting. Room 103 has a fairly updated bathroom. The problem is that the room needs to be aired out. The air cond does not work at this time of year (perhaps never). Opening the window was horrible as the building behind is about 12 feet and the stench of garbage or urine is horrible. Do not stay in this room. Do not accept room 103. We are here only 2 nights and frankly, its a pain to move rooms when we have had so little time to sightsee while here so we have not complained. Note to hotel, provide air freshner and portable fan in this room or don't rent out. Staff is helpful and recommended Doris Restaurant around corner. Had dinner next store the evening before and significantly better than Doris. ","April 4, 2018","2    Condotti Hotel

152,"We stayed in the annexe of Hotel Condotti for 4 nights in February. It may have been an oversight of ours but we had not realised that the annexe was a number of streets away from the main Hotel Condotti. The annexe itself has no Condotti branding, rather is the ‘Stay Inn’. You must, however, check in and out at the main Condotti reception. Vincenzo who took us to our room was very pleasant and said he was available should we need anything though our our stay however we didn’t see him again for the duration of our visit. Only by seeing the signs when walking down the hotel stairs did we learn that reception was on floor 2. The room was fine and clean, our only issue was that the temperature was automatically set due to the time of year and was very warm Indeed. Location is fantastic and we were not disturbed by much noise (only when others were returning late, doors etc). Spagna metro stop only a few minutes walk which is very convenient to get to the Roma termini train station, as is the Spanish steps. Walk to the colosseum and roman forum took 25 minutes or so and there are plenty of shops and restaurants all around. We were initially a little disappointed but I would book again now I know what the arrangement is and how good the location is too.","February 24, 2018","2    Condotti Hotel

157,"I visited this hotel last week with my husband. I had read in many other previous reviews of how people are sent to another room and given a room so small and all those things and to avoid this we wrote a mail well in advance that we will be coming for honeymoon so please do not provide us a room so small or a room without a view ! but as my fear took shape, it happened to us as well, went to another building, and the room was so small that we didn't even have space to open luggage without keeping it on bed. So when we called main hotel reception (remember we are in other building), we are told that the hotel is fully occupied and that they will try their best to upgrade us to a better room next day. Next day we had an early morning tour and my husband was very comfortable to not change rooms again since he said it would only be night when we would crash in. So we unfolded our bags, took out our stuff that we would be needing for next four days since we did not want to open our bags again and again in the tiny room. Next day, we left for our tour and when we came back, voila ! our key wasn't working. we couldn't enter the premises of the rooms and there was no one to help immediately ! so we called up the main Hotel and a person arrives in 15 mins while I am fuming on the top of it. he opens the gate with the master key and asks for our room numbers. when we tell him the room no, he says, the room is given to someone else. Four five mins we have this debate on whose room it is, each of us looking at each other like a cheat ! So now, this person calls up the main Hotel and it turns out that the hotel changed our rooms ! in our absence ! with everything (including very personal items!) in the new room kept in places it was in old room. I don't know if this is a good practice to touch someone's stuff in their absence but I definitely don't like my stuff being touched but the hotel gave an explanation that they assumed we will be okay to be shifted to a new room like that ! Plus side: we got better and bigger room facing the street side ! Also, this was the only hotel in Italy (we stayed in one in Florence and one in Venice), that provided a kettle, some snacks to eat and coffee and tea sachets to be used ! Everywhere else, it was a paid minibar without even a complimentary water bottle. Not so plus side: I still don't like anyone touching my things.","January 28, 2018","2    Condotti Hotel

The Trevi fountain is about a 12 minute walk through lovely cobblestone streets with the hop on hop off bus stop close by.Our room in the main hotel was large by European standards with a large balcony to sit on and look down the street. The bed was very comfortable and good sized bathroom with a strong shower. We even had coffee/tea making facilities in our room which is very unusual in Europe. Our room was serviced everyday with clean fresh towels. Lift was good. We did notice some street noise but nothing extreme and it is a big city after all. The breakfast buffet (which was included in our reasonable room rate) was very good with plenty to choose from. Maybe not as large a choice as we have had but certainly more than enough to have a good breakfast.

The room needs updating and is tiny - with 2 people in the room, it was almost impossible to move around. We had to move furniture around to make room for our bags and to make sure we didn't bump into anything. It was also very stuffy, the AC was practically useless (we were there in spring). And the shower....OMG it was the smallest shower I have ever been in (and I have travelled plenty in Paris which supposedly has the smallest bathrooms in the world). We were on the first floor, and the lift takes you to the first floor, but you still had to carry your own bags one more flight of stairs up (or down) - no concierge to help. The area itself was ok, central enough to walk around to all the sights or take the train. I'd say this hotel is ok, but I'm sure you can find something better at the same price.

183,"Great Hotel. It was my 3rd visit to the Italian capital and my first stay with Raffaello. It is a mid sized hotel located on a quiet part of the bustling Via Urbana. Rooms were very clean and decorated in a traditional style (comfortable beds, good WiFi, quiet & peacful surroundings). Excellent breakfast buffet with very friendly staff and perfect cappuccino's made on request. (There is also a free coffee/tea making facility on a lower level of the Reception area). Check-in & Check-Out were quick and hassle free and all the staff were friendly and greeted us warmly throughout.The location of the hotel is very good. Termini Station is a 5 min walk up hill. The Colleseum is a 10 min walk in the opposite direction either on Via Urbana or the the adjacent Via Cavour. [I'd favour the Via Urbana route as it is more traditional and filled with arty shops and many bars & restaurants]. The Spanish Steps are 20 mins on foot by heading in a *westerly direction*. There is also a nice supermarket next door to the hotel for any essentials or treats.In short I would highly recommend the Hotel Raffaello if travelling to Roma if you are looking for a decently priced mid-range hotel. You are in Rome to explore the City and with this hotel's location everything is accessible. **Ciao Bella Raffaello Roma**","April 2, 2019","3    Hotel Raffaello

189,"We enjoyed our stay. All rooms in Italy seem small. We thought it was a nice place. Fun surprise..we had a small, yet nice size balcony off our room. We were able to walk from the train station, rolling our bags. I think the maps say it was 8 blocks. We had to walk through one of the frequent weekend street protests, but it is not far. Some cobblestone streets, but all in all, very doable. Safe location!","February 9, 2019","3    Hotel Raffaello

191,"We stayed at this hotel recently, even before we arrived the hotel were wonderful, we contacted them on their email and they booked a taxi for us from the airport. The staff were very welcoming when we arrived. Our room was very elegant, the hotel is an old hotel which is well maintained and the decor is inkerping with its age, which we loved. The breakfast in the morning was very enjoyable, plenty to eat, and beautiful scrambled eggs to accompany the continental selection.The hotel is very central for all the attractions, and very close to the train station. There are also plenty of restaurants close by.The only reason I haven’t given it 5 stars is because the mattress cover on the bed has a plastic backing underneath which made me sweat, I totally understand why they have these to protect the mattress, but i have stayed in many hotels that have mattress protectors that are not plastic backed. Apart from that I would recommend this hotel for anybody wanting a city break, that wants an older hotel with good service and within a 30 minute walk to all the attractions.","January 28, 2019","3    Hotel Raffaello

192,"We stayed at Hotel Raffaelo for one week in late November. We got a good price and in addition used the Rick Steve’s discount. The location is excellent: 5 minute walk to Termini, 2 minutes to Santa Maria Maggiore, 10-12 minute walk to the Colosseum. We walk everywhere in Rome but had two early trains for days out so being so close to the station removed any stress. We also had two early morning timed entries at the Vatican and although we could have walked, it is much better to take the Metro from Termini if you have to get there quickly. Upon arrival into Termini, which is always disorienting the first time, walk straight to the farthest exit from the trains. You will be on a large transportation plaza with cabs, buses, etc. Look left and to the first corner past the station for a green Pharmacia sign. Walk downhill on that street for about 5 blocks, perpendicular to the transportation area. Look for Santa Maria Maggiore on the left. You will be at the back of it but it is massive so you can’t miss it. Look for a hotel on the right with Bethlehem in the name and turn right down the alley. You will see the hotel sign right at the end. The hotel is nicely decorated, and extremely clean. The housekeeping staff cleaned thoroughly and restocked toiletries daily. Towels are rather skimpy by American hotel standard. As one reviewer pointed out, there are no washcloths but I bought really cheap ones at home and threw them out each day. Bring your own tissues too. Breakfast was ample and varied. You can eat healthy with fruit, muesli and hard boiled eggs or not with assorted meats and pastries. The breakfast staff is friendly and attentive. The Cappuccino was delicious. Breakfast was always prepared exactly on time and we were provided with breakfast to go on our early mornings out. The front desk staff was competent. One woman was particularly helpful and went above and beyond to try to get us into a site with limited access. There are free maps at the desk, which are better than the Roma Pass maps and even those given out at Marriott. Now for some areas for improvement. The mattresses are just awful. Everyone points that out. Overlays must be requested when you book. They do offer pillow selections an I was happy with my choice of down. The bathroom is tiny and poorly lit. It is nearly impossible to get to the toilet because the bidet faces it about 8 inches away. My tall husband really had trouble. The room was way too hot and despite knobs on the radiators nothing changed. The interior of the hotel was very quiet but our room faced the alley which was noisy with late night arguments and revelers, animals, and early morning garbage and other trucks. Lighting overall was poor, but the armoire was adequate and we had enough room and seating. We tend not to spend much time in a hotel room. The hotel could make some relatively easy improvements with better lighting and mattresses, more shelves in the bathroom and removing the bidet. There are some restaurants in the area, but not as many as I hoped. There is a good grocery store two doors to the left of the hotel. Cheap water, decent wine selection, produce and food for train journeys and picnics. So, if those inconveniences do not bother you, this is an excellent choice. I think the positive aspects outweigh the negative and I would return. My husband might not.","January 26, 2019","3    Hotel Raffaello

193,"I had a cozy single room which wasn't too big but had a quite large and comfy bed. Although the room wasn't very large - as is common in old town hotels - there was enough space for everything, even a big closet. The bathroom was nice and modern. Drinks at the mini bar were free. The TV in the room was, however, very small and didn't work properly. The room itself was a bit dark, but that wasn't a big problem.The hotel is located in a quiet zone, there was no noise coming from outside. The breakfast was excellent, as was the very friendly staff. The whole house was very clean and friendly. Would recommend the hotel for a city trip, as it is located near Termini station and only some 15 minutes by foot from the city centre. Very good value for money.","January 20, 2019","3    Hotel Raffaello

200,"The hotel decor is styled in a classical way but the rooms were very spacious and very comfortable. The reception concierge was helpful and knowledgeable. It is the first time I have ever seen a pillow menu and the location is great. Walking distance to train station and a supermarket that’s open til late two doors down. The only drawbacks I could mention are no kettle in the room. Not a massive thing it we had a baby and needed to heat up some water which meant I needed to come to the breakfast area. The other is the lift, it stops between floors and I guess there is not much you can do about that but if you are less abled it may be a problem, Check with the hotel first to make sure they can help you to and from your room with your luggage.These things didn’t bother me that much though and when I go back to Rome, I will probably stay here.","November 25, 2018","3    Hotel Raffaello

We had a double room ( not economy double) Bed was large, clean and comfy, was even a pillow menu.Little fridge (mini bar), TV (but didn’t use) Free wi-fi. No tea/coffee making facilities in room but you can get free coffee/ tea and little ice buckets of ice ( a lovely touch!) for drinks in your room from the lounge area. Decent supermarket just 2 doors down. Bathroom quite large and clean with shower over bath.Hairdryer provided.Breakfast was lovely, large selection of items..scrambled/hard boiled eggs, toast, bread rolls, hams, cheeses, assorted pastries/doughnuts/cakes, fresh whole fruit, tinned fruit, yoghurts, 4 sorts of cereal, fruit juices, salad. Plentiful tea/coffee. Waiting staff lovely. Location very good, 5-10 walk from Termini station ( get Leonardo Express train from Fiumicino Airport to Termini, every 15 mins, takes half hour €14 each. Take station exit on LEFT leaving Termini station for hotel!) Metro also v easy to use. Just ask for Metro ticket in any tobacconist. Only €1.50 each. Once activated at station you can travel for up to 100 minutes. Great value! Beautiful Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore only about 200 metres away ( go around back for entrance, free to just go inside, or buy ticket for museum/exhibition stuff)  Colosseum only about 10-15 mins walk.All staff we encountered were lovely, friendly and helpful.Would definitely recommend.

A friendly welcome, a lift to the fifth floor in a tiny lift, as the grandparents we received the smallest of the four rooms. It was comfortable enough, with hot water, tv, but somewhat cramped for our taste. Tea and coffee in room would have been nice.An excellent buffet breakfast, and during the day, tea and coffee with pastries were provided free in reception.Generally adequate for our purposes, but situated in an uninspiring side street away from our preferred area of Rome, which required more walking than us oldies would have liked to reach ""where it's at"".Nevertheless if you are fit and like the bohemian atmosphere then this would do you for a day or two.","November 8, 2018","3    Hotel Raffaello

208,"We chose this hotel due to its proximity to the main Termini train station that links direct to the airport (it's about a 5-10 minute walk) and its recommendations from people who are gluten free.The various staff that we encountered during our 5 nights were all universally friendly and helpful. We said that we were gluten free on the first morning and after that, all the staff brought out a plate of gluten free goods and toast each morning. They really looked after us well from that perspective. The breakfast selection on the buffet was a good size and had various options.They also have a coffee machine and kettle with a selection of teabags in the lobby, which is a nice touch. Our room was compact but fine. My only negative would be that the shower cubicle was tiny. I'm not small but not huge either but I struggled to manoeuvre myself in it.Overall, a nice hotel, just off a main shopping street with lovely staff who look after you.

209,"Hands down, our favorite hotel out of the three we visited during our Italy trip.Personnel were the friendliest we encountered during our trip. A shout out to Daniel (day) and Francesca (night) working the front desk. Daniel handled all our inquiries with suggestions/directions and helped with booking the Vatican. He went so far as to help with the coffee maker (which by he way, is available 24 hrs with occasional bakery). Francesca was great offering suggestions for dinner along with great conversation/advise in general. The location is perfect, within walking distance from the train station. However, use google maps as the hotel site directions were a bit confusing. The hop on/hop off bus pick up was 2-3 blocks away. If you enjoy walking, most sites (except Vatican) can be reached on foot. The hotel itself is located near grocery stores, pharmacies and more restaurant choices than you can ever visit. All reasonably priced and good. We walked from the train station, but took a hotel recommended taxi on our return to the airport (50 euros flat fee), which was a good decision with an early international flight out.The room was a good size. We had a walk out balcony (Urbana side) which was totally unexpected. Rooms were large, clean and comfortable. Bathroom was large, but the shower small. The bed was very comfortable (request pillow choice online) and we never heard street noise from the busy street below. Most importantly in Italy, available room safe (request safe key at check-in) and both air conditioning and water pressure were great!Breakfast was ideal (meats, cheeses, pastries, fruit and eggs). Plenty of seating was always available, but were down by 8 am every morning. Loved this hotel and highly recommend !!","October 26, 2018","3    Hotel Raffaello

228,"My family of 4 spent 3 nights at My Guest Roma. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. My boys, 8 and 10, loved the bunk bed. Our room was large, very clean and very comfortable. The breakfast every morning was great and kept us going well past lunch time. Cereal, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, pastries, toast and jam, juices, hot chocolate for the kids and excellent coffee for us. Couldn't have really asked for much more. The location is great, a short bus or metro ride to all of the big sights, a super market 1 block away and plenty of convenience stores, cafes and restaurants a short walk from the property. The biggest selling point, however, is Stefano. He provides personalized service from the minute your reservation is confirmed. He gave us advice on sites to see, the best times to go, which tickets to buy before arriving in Rome and which to buy on site. He arranged for a car to pick us up at the airport and bring us to the property. Once there, he gave us maps and sat down to explain how to get where we wanted to go with the bus and/or metro. He even helped us find the best train prices from Rome to Naples! There is also laundry service, which we used and greatly appreciated. I have never been so well taken care of!

230,"Stayed there through a reference. Had wonderful time! Right from the moment I stepped in, felt almost at home.Yeah the room I chose, was possibly the smallest, but then it was my choice, and it was just about fine for a solo traveller. Stefano is a rockstar. We almost spent an hour on the first day pondering over the map he provided me. And I followed the exact path he had suggested. Next day, repeat ! Another round of discussions and another day to explore. He was extremely helpful when I called him many times over the day. Breakfast is good. Decent spread. Not to forget his support staff. The lady who originally hails from Sri Lanka, and manages Breakfast and house keeping made sure I had a wonderful stay there! Kudos to them. Rooms are just fine, if you are not looking for luxury, this is just perfect. Location, slightly away from the city buzz, but a quick bus hop will take you directly to the main tourist spots. Supermarket bang across the road. Do buy groceries and wine from there. M definitely staying there again, when I go back. And, I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends.

The area has many reasonably priced restaurants & a supermarket is located across the street. The rooms are immaculately clean & very modern. The full international buffet breakfast, if you choose this option, is a wonderful assortment of pastries, cheeses, fruit, eggs, yogurt, beverages etc. The owner, Stefano is very accommodating & friendly.

242,"We had only two days to explore Rome and we could not have picked a better place to stay than My Guest Roma (we found it on Google). The owner, Stefano, took great care to help us plan the perfect itinerary for our short trip. He is so kind and knowledgeable about Rome - it's really 5-star service you're getting here. I am a clean freak (I get sketched out staying in hotels and inns that don't seem sanitary) and this is the cleanest most well-taken care of place I've EVER stayed. The bed was comfortable and the shower was really nice too. The breakfast was very good each day and filled us up. If you want a snack or to buy other things there is a SUPER convenient, upscale market across the street that is open 24-7! You can't ask for more convenience than that. There are great restaurants and gelato shops within a few minutes walk from the inn, which was also wonderful. I see a couple reviews that rated this place less than 5 stars based solely on the fact that it's not right downtown next to the monuments. Let me give travelers some advice. You do NOT want to stay downtown near the monuments. It's more expensive, not as clean, crowded, and tourist-y, and honestly, after exploring the sites for a few hours I was always relieved to be leaving downtown and going back to the clean, safe, quiet, and charming neighborhood where My Guest Roma is. And it's only a few short minutes ride on public transport (only 1.5 euro!) to get downtown from the inn.As for getting downtown, it's easy to use public transport. We walked half a block to the bus stop and took the bus to the sites. It was easy and cheap. We took the metro another day and it's about a 5 block, lovely walk and also easy and cheap. I think this is probably the best deal you can imagine finding in Rome! We are from the US, but if my husband and I return we will certainly stay here again!

We stayed at My Guest Roma for 5 nights in February and it was a pleasure. From the moment we booked the room, Stefano was eager and attentive to ensuring that all of our needs were met. By phone and email he arranged for a driver to pick us up from the airport (for a very reasonable price) and arranged for us to have Shabbat meals in the dining room. When we arrived, Stefano met us at the front door, carried our bags and settled us in. A few minutes later he called us and asked if we had some time to sit down with him. He sat with us for over 45 minutes going over our itinerary for the trip. He made invaluable suggestions for things to leave out and what not to miss. We discussed different modes of transportation and where we were better off walking. He was extremely informative but never pushy or overbearing. It felt like we had a guardian angel in a city where we knew no one. We ended up significantly changing our itinerary based on his suggestions and we are so happy that we did! Every day he brought us a beautiful breakfast and was more than happy to pack up the leftovers (of which there were many) as boxed lunches! He was always available to us and could not have been lovelier. The accommodations themselves were clean and comfortable. The location was great and everywhere we wanted to go was easily accessible. We will always associate our amazing trip to Rome with Stefano and My Guest Roma. We will certainly recommend them to all of our friends and family and hope one day to stay there again ourselves!

He also gave us a map showing nearby gluten free restaurants which was handy. Stefano was able to answer all our questions and gave us some options in where to go that was child friendly, Villa D'este was one example that we all enjoyed although the bus journey was pretty long. He was always at the end of the phone when needed using WhatsApp and couldn't have been more helpful.

Once at the hotel he made us feel right at home. He was at the doorstep to personally welcome us ""home"" and sat with us explaining the city and suggesting itineraries. The guest house delivers perfectly on what they offer. We were 4 in one large room, with single comfy beds. Bathroom was super clean and serviced daily. We overlooked a small interior courtyard. No noise at all from the street. Charming 1930s house, off the super touristy areas of the city but very well connected by two bus lines and a 10 minute walk to Bologna subway station. Hearty european style breakfast, with an assortment of pastries, rolls, jams, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, cherry tomatoes, yoghurt, fresh fruit, juice and of course, espresso! It might not sound like much, but it will get you going until lunch. The neighborhood is super nice and safe. There is a 24 hour supermarket just one block away as well as a nice restaurant/bar one block down and across. After a long day of walking it was a lively place to go have a drink and relax just steps from your room. On our last day one of us left very early in the morning and Stefano left a breakfast tray in our room the night before, with all we had liked having for breakfast. That is attention to detail!

The highlight of this location is the terrific hospitality provided by Stefano, who welcomed us with tea and crackers and provided us with detailed orientation to Rome highlights, public transportation and local neighborhood resources.The (kosher) breakfast is an excellent way to start the day with a variety of options including fresh fruit, bread, cheese, yoghurt, cereal and excellent coffee (as much as you need).","January 21, 2017","4    My Guest Roma

260,"Being in Rome for the second time and OF COURSE stayed again at „MyGuestRoma“ – where else ?If you decide to enjoy your stay at “MyGuest Roma”, you will find yourself in a very nice area, quiet and not crowded by tourists but nevertheless equipped with nice restaurants, supermarkets and cafes as well as some shops. All you need for a comfortable stay is easy in reach. Getting there is uncomplicated with several bus lines (between 2 and 5 minutes walk) or with the subway (maybe around 7 minutes walk). If you arrive by plane my suggestion would be to ask Stefano to organize a pickup by taxi. Besides it’s the most convenient way, in my eyes it gives you a nice trip through the city as well.Again, we stayed in the comfortable 4-bed-room with an en-suite bathroom. The room is equipped with enough space to store your luggage, a TV and a fridge. And this is what I love about this place – all these nice little things that make your stay even better and that show that there is someone who obviously thinks a lot about the needs of his guests ! Enjoy the advantage of having breakfast in the small but cosy breakfast room. First, because this breakfast will be a perfect start into your day. Second – just use the chance of getting in touch very easy with other guests. Nothing as useful as other guests to share ideas and plans.Besides all other advantages of staying here – the best thing was, is and will most probably remain Stefano and his team. Stefano knows everything, has everything and does everything for his guests. And this of course without being obtrusive. He is just there when needed…..We always wonder how he has the right tips for each person – seems, as he feels which kind of interests you do have .If you are looking for a really great place to stay in Rome – you found it.","December 18, 2016","4    My Guest Roma

261,"Anything I say will not do justice to our wonderful experience with Stefano and My Guest Roma. As amazing as our trip was, staying here and working with Stefano before and during our stay was the icing on the cake. Communication was quick and helpful (He and Ida had an enourmous amount of patience with all my questions), and as soon as we arrived, it was like coming home. Stefano helped us with our itinierary when we arrived, advising us on the best way to see Rome which was different - and a better use of our time - than we originally planned. We found ourselves saying multiple times, ""Stefano was right!"" The room itself was clean, comfortable, spacious and exactly as described. We had a quadruple room for three people and there was more than enough storage space. It was cleaned every day. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful, including lots of coffee. If we left earlier than it was served, Stefano made sure we had it in our room to go the night before. Centrally located, there are a bunch of bus lines a few minutes walk from the bed and breakfast and the metro is about a 10 minute walk. All busses and subway are a short trip to anywhere you want to go in the city including to Termini if you're leaving the city. Our stay included Saturday and as we are Sabbath observers, Stefano made sure that we had every accommodation. In addition to being professional and hard working, Stefano was also great to talk to, it very much added to our stay. It really was the best we could have hoped for and we can't wait to come back and stay. Thank you Stefano!","December 6, 2016","4    My Guest Roma

I stayed in a single room, which is small but cheerfully decorated and well-organised so that the space does not feel cramped. There's a safe in the room for valuables, and a small fridge. The B&B is very good value.Stefano is extremely accommodating, happy to offer suggestions and advice for things to do in Rome even for those who have already been there many times and seen the main sights (I used to live there). He will do anything he can to make your stay more comfortable and enjoyable.The location, though not central, is convenient--well connected by bus and a short walk from a metro stop, making it easy to get to the city center.

We loved the building, high ceilings, our room was quiet, clean, and beds were very comfortable, good a/c, and a mini plasma, mini refrigerator, spacious bathrm. Location was outstanding for our needs, good public transportation, close to the synagogue and good shopping district in the neighborhood of Piazza Bologna. Amenities were great, a Shabbat hot plate, kosher food for breakfast, preparations for Shabbat Kiddush. Stefano caters his B & B, to all tourists, kosher or not. We met people from everywhere, although it is a small B & B, so you need to book in advance. It provides an intimate environment and Stefano is always there to make you feel at home away from home with his attentive staff.

269,"Stayed back in June '16 with my partner on our first trip to Rome. I was attracted to this B&B due to the high ratings and positive reviews on TripAdvisor, and I am glad to say that My Guest Roma did indeed live up to its perceived standards. In a nutshell, MGR is a clean and welcoming guesthouse which is managed by Stefano, a highly attentive and warm host. I do not exaggerate when I claim that he will go out of his way to assist you with every aspect of your stay. The B&B is situated in more of a local part of Rome, where tourists are more rare; this suited us in the way that was less hustle and bustle, and it provided insight into another version of the more commonly seen and advertised Rome. The nearest Metro station is a rough and straightforward 15 minute walk; the Metro is then only a 10 minute journey into the heart of the city. More conveniently, a large 24/7 supermarket is only a minute's walk away and you can find a surprisingly vast selection of foods here!Booking the room was simple and fast - the staff are always alert to messages and e-mails and they understand English well. I was pleased to discover that they offer the arrangement of a taxi to transport you between the airport and the B&B itself. This is pre-arranged before arrival and it is worth doing so, to ease any stresses of the journey. At Fiumicino airport, the taxi driver was fairly easy to spot amongst the many pick-up drivers, and the journey to MGR was relaxing. Upon arrival to MGR, Stefano was there to greet my partner and I; he made it clear that we had the chance to rest if required, before offering us a chance to discuss the plans of our trip. From this experience, it was evident that Stefano had extensive knowledge of all the go-to-areas in Rome - from where individual bus stops are located, to the best places to eat out and what times best to visit the Vatican City to avoid the worst of the queues. The advice offered and willingness to bond with his guests is certainly a quality of Stefano's which definitely distinguishes him from typical hosts.The room itself was clean, cool and welcoming. It was simplistic in the manner that there were only the bare necessities required for a temporary stay, e.g., small table and chairs to eat at, and a sufficient wardrobe. This was not a problem and added to the character of the room - the only improvement that I would suggest is an instalment of a full-length mirror, in addition to the lone (yet large) mirror in the bathroom. There is a safe which I trusted to put my valuables inside, and Stefano kindly instructed us on how to use it. Moreover, there is a TV that can be watched from the comfort of the bed. Our room was situated on the far end of the hall, and outside the window lay a small garden which was lovely. In the hall outside of the room, there is a kettle along with cups, and a selection of coffee and tea. Brochures and leaflets are available also, displaying information about possible tourist sites to visit.We opted to eat breakfast at MGR and had the chance to choose the time we would attend every morning. The selection of foods consisted of fresh croissants (a mix of chocolate and plain), fruits, breads, cereals and cheeses. Juice and hot drinks were available too. The breakfast sufficed for the typically long day ahead, but it was also an opportunity to chat to Stefano, discussing our plans for the day and the routes to the places we wished to visit.Overall, I would recommend staying at MGR for a pleasant stay with the warmest host. Thank you Stefano - you outshone our expectations and you are a most kind and generous gentleman. Amina and Richard x","August 26, 2016","4    My Guest Roma

280,"Hotel Indigo – St. George is a newly renovated hotel located just east of the Tiber River in Rome. The location is above average as it is only 20 minutes walking or 5 minutes driving form the Vatican City. The hotel is set on a quiet side street that is just one block away from Via de Banchi Vecchi which is actually a nice strip of local restaurants and shops. Banchi Vecchi is unique because it seems to be a good mix of locals and tourists enjoying good food and drinks away from all the bustle of Roma city. We witnessed a vibrant happy hour in the early evening where people lined the streets and freely enjoyed wine.The main draw to Hotel Indigo is the updated lobby and the renovated rooms. The place overall looks great but there were quite a few downfalls during the stay, especially for a 5-star labelled hotel. The first major issue was the central air conditioning situation. Our room did not have proper working air and we notified the staff upon arrival. They attempted to fix the issue twice but were unsuccessful, which made showering and sleeping difficult. We also had an issue with the service to the room. We requested some silver ware to the room as we needed a few plates and forks. They couldn’t bring anything to the room because they said all staff were busy with a rooftop happy hour, causing us to go down to the restaurant and finding our own silver ware. We did not feel a priority during our stay there.Location (4/5)  +Great location on a quiet side street, very close to the Vatican but away from tourism+Vatican only 5 minutes away, other major attractions only such as Colosseo only 10 minutes away+Close to local restaurants, markets, sandwich shops, and gelato Room (2/5) +Clean and well decorated-Air conditioning was an issue for whole stay-Pretty small room and tight quarters Bathroom (2/5)+Clean-Small shower and very small vanity area with sink-Lighting was not great, difficult to get ready in Additional Space (2/5) +Good size closet and nice sitting area for coffee or dessert+One small sofa in the room-Not much else to the room, mainly a place to sleep  Comfort (1/5)  -Hard to judge a room that was consistently 75+ degrees Fahrenheit Service (2/5) +Concierge was very helpful and the lobby offered refined comfort-Service to the room was basically non-existent and made the stay rigid Breakfast (N/A)","May 6, 2019","6    Hotel Indigo Rome - St. George

281,"This is an excellent hotel. The staff was very friendly and professional and the rooms were clean and quite comfortable. As an added bonus they always had a ginger, honey infused water that was really good and very refreshing. The location was great too. It is in a quiet part of the city but everything is walkable if you are in reasonable condition. It was a 15 minute walk to the Pantheon 10 minutes to Piazza Navona, and about a 20 minute walk to the Vatican. There were a ton of great places to eat heading towards any of those locations as well. The bus stops were all quite close as well when we needed to reach locations a bit farther out like St. Paul's or the Colosseum (though we did actually walk to the Colosseum once or twice as well). The rooftop bar is a great private retreat to hangout in the evening. They say when you toss a coin from your right hand over you're left shoulder into the Trevi Fountain you'll return to Rome some day.

You could still go up and enjoy the view at night. We bought a bottle of wine at a local shop and had an amazing time looking at the city (and listening to unexplained fireworks. Forgot to ask the staff what they were for.)The shuttle service from the airport had zero issues finding the hotel. We asked the staff 3 of the mornings to have a taxi available at a certain time with a 100% success rate.Didn't eat lunch or dinner there. But happily started every day with breakfast and finished every night (save the one on the rooftop) in the bar.So, if you're to throw a coin in the Trevi Fountain to come back to Rome, what do you do to make sure you can stay at the St. George the next time?","January 20, 2019","6    Hotel Indigo Rome - St. George

294,"We stayed for one night during a trip through Europe. We had been wanting to visit Rome for years but also wanted to make sure we stayed in the heart of everything given the short timeframe. This hotel delivered on location and experience. It is in a very old building but has been updated - very cool and very clean.The front desk attendant, Orietta (sp), was excellent and very nice. We arrived earlier than check-in however was kind enough to help find us a room without waiting long. We were on our honeymoon and she went above and beyond providing us with a nice note and bottle of wine. Very nice touch!We thoroughly enjoyed our quick stay and are already talking about a return.

295,"We had selected Hotel Indigo Rome for its great central location to all the popular tourist attractions - only about 16 minutes walk to the Piazza Navona, and equally convenient walking distance to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, etc. Excellent location! The Hotel Indigo is located in a nice, quiet location with only a small narrow street front with hardly any traffic to speak of (see photos). This makes it very nice location for walking to the various attractions. All the buildings in this neighborhood looks like old architecture on the outside but well maintained physically - including the Hotel Indigo. I read that all buildings in the historic, central location of Rome must maintain their historic appearance on the outside. The Hotel Indigo outside architecture does indeed match the historic designs of the other buildings in the area. However, when we entered the Hotel Indigo, we were pleasantly surprised about the inside design of the hotel. The interior designs of the lobby, lounge, restaurant, bar and our room were all very comfortably modern. This feature may disappoint some people who were expecting the interior to be historically designed as the outside, but for us we prefer the more modern design. At least for us, we found the modern design more ""like home"" and very comfortable and inviting. Having stayed at other centrally located Rome hotels that were historically designed both inside and outside, we felt that the Hotel Indigo design suites us better. I have attached several photos of the Hotel that illustrates the nice design features of the hotelThe check-in process was quick and easy, and as a bonus for us being a Spire-Elite IHG club member, we were upgraded from the Standard Room to a Mini-Suite. We found the Mini-Suite to be very spacious and comfortable - large living and bedroom areas with separate TV's in both rooms, small walk-in closet with mini-bar that is complimentary for Mini-Suite guests and nice size bathroom. The rooms were very nicely appointed and there are murals on the walls of the bedroom and bathroom that is very ""Romanesque"" - a very nice touch.We ate at the Hotel restaurant for breakfast and dinner and found the service to be very good and the food quality to be good as well. The restaurant design is also quite modern and very comfortable which again is fine with us.For our next trip to Rome, I would definitely select the Hotel Indigo Rome because of the comfortable accommodations and great central location.","December 8, 2018","6    Hotel Indigo Rome - St. George

This beautiful hotel is tucked away in a quiet street and yet is within walking distance of all Rome's great attractions. There are many nearby cafes, bars and restaurants. Even a dry cleaner across the street! I was warmly welcomed and allocated a lovely junior suite overlooking the courtyard. The room was so nice I regret not staying longer! The room was beautiful appointed, extremely comfortable; and spotless. I slept soundly and enjoyed a nice breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Food selection was quite good, featuring Italian and British dishes. The espresso coffee was terrific. Cocktails at the hotel bar were awesome, accompanied by very generous snacks. Having stayed at many IHG properties around the world, I'm glad I tried out Indigo - this hotel is very elegant.

The hotel is situated in a small road and close to all attractions within walking distance. there are great small restaurants and pubs in the streets next to the hotel and Trastevere district is 10 min walk if you want to spend an evening out.We will surely recommend the hotel to our friends and will love to come again.","November 5, 2018","6    Hotel Indigo Rome - St. George

303,"We recently stayed at the Hotel Indigo Rome - St George. We had a fabulous time. Our room was large and well appointed. The bathroom was spacious with excellent products to use. Whilst at the hotel we had dinner in the Roof Terrace restaurant. The view from the terrace over the roof tops of Rome is spectacular. Our meal commenced with a basket of delicious warm bread rolls and bread sticks. We also had an appetiser which was a gift from the chef. I had steak which was cooked perfectly and my wife had pasta, tomato and lobster tail. She said it was just stunning. We enjoyed Prosecco with our meal. For dessert I had lemon with meringue and my wife had creme brûlée with exotic fruits.The service throughout the meal was impeccable and the live music added to the most romantic atmosphere.We also enjoyed drinks one night in a bar which is also located on the Roof Terrace and on another night we had drinks in the inner courtyard which is also just lovely. The greenery, reflection pool and music made the inner courtyard the most perfect way to relax after a busy day sight seeing.We loved the breakfasts in the hotel, the choice of food is just wonderful, the focaccia was my favourite.The hotel's location is very special, so close to the Vatican, Piazza Navona, Pantheon and Trevi Fountain. One early morning we walked to the Vatican to enjoy the beautiful sunrise before St Peter's Basilica got crowded.From the little touches of chocolates, lollies and water in the lobby to the highly skilled and knowledgable staff, the Hotel Indigo made our time in Rome so memorable.

The property is beautiful and we especially enjoyed having a drink at the rooftop restaurant while admiring the view of the city. We were pleased with the helpful service and effort to ensure we were comfortable, secured transportation easily and that our food and beverages were prepared to our liking. We did not have the opportunity to use the gym or spa given our brief stay, unfortunately. While this is a luxury property, the cost was high for the size of the rooms and for breakfast not to be included. Additionally, in a couple of instances, we had to track down our servers to order additional drinks, settle the bill and request the status of our food. This was not the case every time, but I mention it because we encountered this situation in three different instances. With that said, the issues were not enough to deter us from returning again.

316,"Having lived in Rome for 5 years many years ago and stayed in a few good hotels, this one gets 10/10! Lovely rooms and decor, steeped in history and on a lovely cobbled back street this small but modern hotel ticked all our boxes. Could not fault it in any way. Exceptionally clean, very good standards, great smelling toiletries ( not the dinky, stingy seed ones some 5 start hotels use that have no scent!) Staff all very friendly, polite. Roof top bar is too romantic and cosy with staff offering free fleece blankets to keep the chill off on a windy eve. On our last night we walked up the street and turned left to discover a fabulous (expensive) celebrity haunt called Pierluigi which was fine dining and you can rub shoulders with the stars here, supermodels and famous celebrities turning up constantly. What a find! We accidentally found it and waited for an hour in the lounge for a table as we told them we were guests at the Indigo and got a table, pricey but worth it just for the experience to see a famous face. One of Rome's little kept secrets... I would definitely reccommend Hotel Indigo if you are a couple and wanting a more intimate cosy stay away from the big 5 star type hotels. I would definitely return again as it was located in a perfect spot a few mins walk from Piazza Navona, Pantheon, Castle Sant Angelo and other historical attractions. I will give this hotel 10/10 as I could not fault int in any way. Thank you all the staff for making our stay very memorable and hope to return very soon.

It was stylishly decorated and had a very comfortable bed, nice sitting room with sofa and desk and bathroom with separate sink and tub/toilet room. This is always convenient for two people to get ready in the mornings. Also, I loved the toiletries!The service was excellent; friendly and efficient. We loved the area the hotel in. It is on an old and quiet street, Giulia, but easy to walk to lots of sites, such as the Vatican and Piazza Navona.

335,"Positives: clean, safe, location to sitesI may be more particular than you but my issues are these; At arrival this was the first of 4 hotels with no staff to check us in, but rather an Italian man who spoke not a word of English who seemed uncomfortable being there alone watching us stand there not knowing what was going on. Had the check in desk had a small sign notifying guests that someone would be back in 10 or 15 min. we'd have felt better. This man only made us feel a bit uneasy as he kept speaking Italian to us. We assumed based on his appearance that he may have been a relative of the owner who was given a job as a kind gesture. What I really was not happy about was when the counter woman who showed up after 15 min. of us waiting gave our key to this 'porter' to show us to our room and take our bags. After shlepping our luggage from the train station by foot, did I really need a porter to 'wheel' our bags down the hall to our room? NO. She should have asked if we'd like him to accompany us to our room. I resented tipping him, which I felt obligated to do. They made this a compulsory service. Funny enough this was the only hotel with our room just down the hall from the service desk.  Walking into our room, I noticed the headboard was a fabric that obviously couldn't be washed, or disinfected with Lysol wipes etc. so I went down the hall, checking for an unlocked linen closet, which thankfully I found. Without the headboard barrier we created from a bed sheet, I'd have slept with my feet hanging off the end of the bed, to avoid contact. Happy with the wood floors.  Breakfast selection was 'okay', but the service at the breakfast was excellent. I was able to walk to this small kitchen and request a whole orange and tomato. I didn't like the way they were presented, so I was thrilled not to have been hassled about my requests.  There was construction one level below our building at 7:30 am but for early risers this wouldn't be a problem. At least they were repairing whatever they were fixing.","April 28, 2019","7    Hotel Italia

340,"Wonderfully located close to Termini station and other landmarks. Combined with decent pricing and a good breakfast makes this hotel very appealing. The hotel is on the first floor of what seems to be an apartment building, with some rooms in a building across the street, and you have to be buzzed into the building. Our room in particular was across the street and we experienced some road noise at night and in the morning, though it was tolerable. The only thing that keeps me from giving the hotel full marks is that when we asked about the pricing of the laundry service we were told that it varied, that was it. Come to find out later after having our laundry done that they charge per article of clothing. If I had known that I would have saved my 30€ that it cost me for them to do it and take it to a laundromat myself. ","February 21, 2019","7    Hotel Italia

In fact there was no indication of a locker being there in the first place and the staff wouldn’t show any evidence of the issue. They demanded us to pay an absolutely ridiculous fee at a price point of 70 euros, which if you ask me is an absurd and unreasonable for a small locker that was none-existent. As mentioned earlier the staff treated the situation in a very disrespectful and frightening manner that possibly reflects through the rest of their service. In all reverence I can honestly say that I would hope to never experience being falsely accused like this again and hope they can handle likewise situations in a more delicate manner in the future.","February 5, 2019","7    Hotel Italia

343,"Having read the previous reviews I was really looking forward to staying here. Once we arrived just by see the facade of this place I knew it would be wonderful. You have to use the intercom buzzer to get access but all good for security. It has the sweetest old style lift which was a treat. Once we arrived on our floor it was spotlessly clean, very bright and the reception was extremely welcoming. Our room was a bit on the small size but was perfectly adequate for us. We didn't spend much time there anyway with so much to do in Rome. I can't find a fault at all, clean, modern yet traditional, friendly. The big thing here is location, it is extremely central and within walking distance of all the main attractions you would lije to see in Rome. The breakfast is typical European continental but again everything was delicious and plentiful, no sooner was it running low everything was freshly replenished. As I'm sure you can tell by now I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to this wonderful city, we booked the weekend for my 40th birthday and to have this place as a base made the whole weekend perfect.

I was able to go online and book a room at Hotel Italia starting the same day for three nights. We made our way over to the property, arriving exhausted and drained from our ordeal. ABDUL at the front desk was incredible. Through a computer glitch, it first appeared that he didn't have a room for us, even though I had just booked it and he showed our reservation. He kindly and graciously kept looking and trying to find us a room and eventually was able to accommodate us. We couldn't even believe it, all the effort he made on our behalf and his ultimate success. He MADE our trip. Beyond that, the location of the hotel is ideal. Not super touristy but right in the heart of everything. Easy walking to every historical site - about a half mile (30 min) walk from the Vatican and even less from the Forum and Colosseum.

354,"Comfortable beds! Quiet rooms! Walking distance to everything! Those were my biggest requests when we travel and this hotel met them. It is located in an apartment building on the entire 2nd floor, so you have to ring the buzzer to be let in. Never a problem, just need to know what you are looking for in your arrival. The owner of the restaurant across the street assisted us with no problems. 2 small restaurants right across the street that serves delicious food, so that was convenient. About 10 blocks from everything and we enjoyed the walks every day. It is just off a major street so catching a bus is easy, but it also offers more restaurant and gelato choices (Green Pistachio! Awesome gelato store!!!). Breakfast is pretty much the same thing every day, and it is good. The staff is kind and accommodating. The hallways are carpeted so that keeps the noise down too. For the price, this is a really good hotel.

What I liked about this hotel was: - convenient enough location (just off a main street) with easy accessibility to bus transportation and even subway - breakfast was good enough continental breakfast (even though you may run out of seats if you don't go out early and the food keeps running out because its just a small counter), tasty coffee, tasty hot chocolate, friendly staff - very friendly staff at the counter - very clean - near enough supermarket less than 5 minutes away - good restaurants opposite the hotelWhat we didn't like about this hotel was: - very difficult to adjust the temperature in our room (during winter). when we get in after walking around the whole day the room would be toasty hot. the only way to cool it to an acceptable temperature would be to open the windows which would make the room quite noisy or subject to a breeze. it appears the heater also shuts off sometime in the middle of the night. if you prefer an even temperature throughout the room throughout your stay ... this is not the place - you can hear people walking outside and if you are staying near enough to the breakfast area you will hear people talking as well - the beds can be a bit too soft? our backs started to hurt. it could be a combination of the soft beds and uneven room temperature - they advertised free bottled water in our superior room but we never got any. - the queen bed (like in some other hotels) are actually two smaller beds put together - the shower is quite small and if you are not careful you can slip on the shower floor(basically I will barely fit if I sit on the shower floor) - you have to leave key at the counter when you leave - street outside the hotel a quite dirty ... you could literally step on someones poop - even newly renovated rooms of the hotel have ""older"" electrical plugs ... so it still feels a bit old","May 2, 2018","7    Hotel Italia

The breakfast offered is quite small and basic but it gets the job done. Their cappuccinos are SO GOOD. I had two every morning. Convenient place where you get what you pay for.","January 12, 2018","7    Hotel Italia

364,"We stayed here for 3 nights. Hotel is housed in a historic building and its rooms are in two buildings across from each other. Make sure to ask for your room to be in the newer building; and remember to have coins available for the operation of the elevator in the newer building. Hotel is clean; but it needs a renovation.Hotel staff are very kind and friendly. The daily breakfast is good; but the space for serving breakfast is very limited; therefore make sure to get there before 9:00 am.Hotel is in walking distance to Piazza Repubblica, main train station (Termini) and Imperial Forum and Altare della Patria. You can get to any of these attractions anywhere from 10-30 minutes.","December 31, 2017","7    Hotel Italia

We had the economy double room which was ok for us students on a budget but would recommend spending more if you can. The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the main train station/bus station and about 15 minutes to all major landmarks. There are supermarkets and restaurants nearby.

366,"Room was nice but I admit I don't get the ""twin beds"" in a room for a married couple. Abdul was very helpful in the reservation process and also in person. Only complaint is light just inside door did not work and it is in front of a mirror, so I used that to apply makeup while my husband was in the shower. I asked about it the first day and it was never fixed (or bulb changed). Otherwise our stay was fine. We walked to all major attractions including the Collosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, etc. Taxi driver from airport had no idea where it was and it took 3 times as long as it should have to get there, but otherwise no complaints.","October 17, 2017","7    Hotel Italia

Very nice and professional reception staff. We arrived prior to check in time and they graciously held our bags till the room was ready allowing us to so some sightseeing. Common areas were very clean. We were in the rooms across the street from the front desk area, there is a small lift/elevator that we used only when moving our bags. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and larger than I anticipated. Street noise was minimal for a room in a large city.

368,We booked this room because a) it was cheap and b) it was in walking distance of everything we wanted to see in Rome. So it fulfilled our two main needs but I will say the photos are deceiving as the rooms are VERY tiny. We walked from the train station to this hotel and was easy to find. You have to be buzzed into the building to get to the hotel. There was one girl who manned the front desk most days and she was very friendly and pleasant. One day there was only a man at the front desk who we had a negative experience with - the phone in our room wasn't working and we were trying to book a restaurant as it was my birthday. My fiancé went to speak with him for help twice and the man basically shooed him away saying the phone in our room did work and we were wrong. Ok... we walked to the restaurant to reserve it since our phone didn't work and he didn't offer to call for us. The only other thing we didn't like is you have to leave your key at the front desk anytime you leave which is annoying if there's a line at the front desk when you come back and you just want to get into your room. It's a fine stay if you're not too picky and just want somewhere cheap in a good location in Rome.,"October 5, 2017","7    Hotel Italia

372,"This hotel is located very centrally, within easy walking distance of many sights. However, the room was really minuscule, probably the second smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in, and that's saying a lot, as we visit Japan every year (famous for its tiny rooms). Not even enough space to open two luggages. The shower unit was so small, it was really elbow to elbow. If you're on the bigger side, the shower won't fit you. The saving grace was the staff, very friendly, very accommodating and nice. The breakfast was also decent, but the staff attitude was what made the stay bearable. I would say this place would be fine for a short stay (one night!). Any longer and you'll get cabin fever.","July 14, 2017","7    Hotel Italia

373,"We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Italia very much. The location is great, it is within walking distance to all the main tourist attractions: the Coloseum, the Forum, Fontana di Trevi, Trajans forum, and many other ancient sites. There is excellent cuisine just outside the hotel. You have to go to Pepi Maurilio on Via del Viminale, just around the corner, with John. This is one of the best meals we had while in Italy. The hotel staff was very friendly and very accommodating. They have a great breakfast setup every morning, self serve style. Just one catch, they charge you for it at the time of check out. Also, no parking, unless you find a spot on the street. The room we stayed in was tiny, although cozy. It had AC and was cleaned daily. The bed was a queen size. And the biggest deal for us: we weren't told beforehand NOT to drive in between 6 am and 6 pm into the part of Rome that the hotel is in. It is in a controlled traffic zone (ZTC) and you get a 90€ fine for driving in during those hours. Some hotels will get you a permit or waive the fine, but not this one. In spite of these few setbacks, it was still a good stay.","July 13, 2017","7    Hotel Italia

385,"This was our first trip to Rome, and we didn't realize until we got there how convenient this lovely little hotel would be! We chose it because of the good reviews, and were so happy to find out what a good choice it was. It was only about a 15 minute walk from the train station (and easy to find once we got a city map), only about half a block from a Metro station. It is a very old building (as is about every building in Rome) but was obviously renovated and modernized inside. I am not even sure how many rooms there were, but I think only about 4? Our room was great - good bed, computer, very nice shower and bathroom, extremely clean. One of the best things was the breakfast room, the cost of the breakfast buffet was included in the room charge, and it had all sorts of pastries, cereals, bread for toast, a Nespresso coffee machine, fruit, juice.....we loved it as most of the places we stayed in Italy did not offer a breakfast. The staff (we only saw two of them) were so nice and helpful, especially Barbara who was happy to help with anything (such as translating some postage forms that I could not understand!) The first night we were there was just took a walk (having no idea where we were going) down the street and after about 10 minutes the Colosseum loomed before us! The sun was setting and made the Colosseum almost glow. So just realizing how close we were to the Colosseum, the Forum, and the Palatine Hill made this hotel choice even better. There are tons of restaurants everywhere in Italy, but Barbara did give us a couple of suggestions which we did follow up on, and they were excellent. When we wanted to go somewhere further away in the city, the Metro was very convenient. I would highly recommend Inn Urbe Colosseo and would definitely go back there again if I am lucky enough to get back to Italy!","October 16, 2017","8    Inn Urbe Colosseo

386,"When I was looking for a room for my wifes suprise 40th, I was after somewhere that was close to the city's attractions, and this place certainly ticked the boxes.Firstly, I wasnt after something that had all the bells and whistles on, literally just a base for somewhere to sleep and shower. So I was suprised to see some extra touches. The b&b kindly organised airport transfers for me. As it was my wifes birthday I thought why not, so that was handy, allthough I believe the shuttle to the town is just outside the airport for 8 odd euro.The room itself comes with a flat screen t.v (which we never turned on) and also a laptop, which is handy if you want to book a last minute excursion. There was a mini bar with soft drinks and beer, all be it small, it was only 1 euro per drink. Wi Fi in the hotel worked fine.Breakfast consisted of a small selection of pastries, breads, fruit, hot/cold drinks, yogurts and meat/cheese. Not a huge amount, but enough to get you started in the day.Room was cleaned daily, so no complaints there. Shower was good, towels were supplied. Responded swiftly to e-mails to arrange transport back to the airport. There is a metro station straight outside the hotel more or less, which is the best way to get about Rome. Also the Colosseum is only 5 mins down the road.All in all, I couldnt fault the room. One thing I would say, was that it could be a little tricky to find, as there isnt a sign as such on the outside, just a small buzzer on the door outside with the name on there. No major issue, but we did struggle the first night to find the b&b again.We will stay here again for our next visit to Rome for sure, good job guys :)","September 27, 2017","8    Inn Urbe Colosseo

402,"First, I would and will stay here again. We selected this B & B because it is located in the Rione Monti area that we know well and love (I have been to Italy 20+ and Rome 15+).. The B&B is a 3 minute walk from metro cavour and a 4 minute walk to about 25 restaurants. The train station is a 20 minute walk or 1 metro stop away as is the Coliseum. I especially like the area because there are easily 40 restaurants within a 15-20 minute radius and after being busy all day I like to be able to walk to and from dinner. Next, cleanliness. Super clean and I especially like that the duvet is in a cover that is washed between clients so one is not sitting on a bedspread that someone else has used. All units are non smoking. Floors are wood and they provide slippers for guests. Room size: The room is huge for Rome standards, and we found it to be a very comfortable size . We had a twin bedded room and each bed was larger than the usual; not quite a double but bigger than a U.S. twin. The shower in the bathroom was at least 4' in length.Convenience: KEYLESS entry to building, b&B and room. You use a pin code. Having stayed at other b&b's where I have had to carry heavy keys and jiggle the keys to open some doors, the keyless entry is a bonus. Very nice room darkening window drapes. There is free wifi and also a ipad in the room. Also, we found the mini bar in the room especially convenient because although there are charges for water or juice, they are very reasonable. Water was 50 cents; I think juice was 1 euro. I think this is a lovely courtesy that they offer their clients. Breakfast: Excellent quality and variety; yogurts, toast, cured meats, cheese, cereals, fresh fruit, pastries, jams, etc. Laura who was there during our stay is a delight. She is kind and sincerely helpful. She suggested we visit a nearby church that has a statue of Moses sculpted by Michaelangelo. I have no negatives; however point of information: there is no elevator so you do have to climb some steps but Laura helps with luggage, and I am 65 and had no problems with the steps.","May 19, 2015","8    Inn Urbe Colosseo

Room had it's own net book and sky TV. Room was overlooking main road so back rooms may be slightly quieter but excellent double glazed windows. Domenico was very helpful helping us with restaurant reservations. All staff very friendly and helpful-could use computer to print tickets FOC. Room was cleaned each day.

The room was well equipped and maintained with the basic necessities. There were even additional facilities such as sky TV, a laptop and a safe.The neighbourhood is also relatively safe with a police station in the vicinity. The main door and room doors were locked using electronic number locks so you don't have the fear of losing any keys for the room as well.As we rented the room near Rome Day (21 April), Domenico was also very kind and printed out the events that were happening during that period.Overall, the stay was pleasant and is definitely recommended for its simplicity, cleanliness, practicality and convenient location!","April 23, 2015","8    Inn Urbe Colosseo

405,"We stayed here at the beginning of March 2014. ROOM: anyone who knows Rome a bit knows that hotel rooms are notoriously small and expensive. Here we booked accommodation for three and got a relatively big room at a decent price. It does not come with extras like bathrobes and slippers, but it has a lovely modern design, the beds are good, the bathroom is nice and the place is well kept. CHILDREN: We traveled with a nine year-old. As third bed we got a roll-away bed that was placed at the foot of our king-sze bed. As far as we know, it was comfortable and there still was enough space in the room. BREAKFAST: simple continental breakfast with very tasty pastries. LOCATION: close to the Colosseum, but the street is on a hill, which is good to know if you plan to do everything on foot. The metro is near and there are busses in the area.RECOMENDED: absolutely. We enjoyed our stay.","April 11, 2015","8    Inn Urbe Colosseo

We stayed for 5 nights and Sandra was on duty at our arrival to show us around the room, details for breakfast and tips around the city. I (Eliana) mentioned about the lemon trees around the city and how much we loved lemon... To my surprise, the next morning there was a lemon cake as one of the items for breakfast! We've stayed in many luxury hotels around the world and we know what means to go the extra mile specially that we always worked in hotels... and the little details this small, cute and modern hotel did during our stay surprisingly put them in the same level of service as many 5 stars we know. Massimo and Sandra were always trying to help and even asking if we needed anything extra at all. The hotel is modern, clean, the bed is great, breakfast is a plus and Sandra and Massimo were the key to make our stay perfect!

407,"I spent a lot of time trying to find a place in Rome that is suitable for us and this B&B met all our expectations. It` s very close to the center, in walking distance to the Colosseum and the metro station is some steps away. The street itself even though is in the heart of the city is very quiet so you don` t have problem with seeping. There are only four rooms in the B&B so you feel kinda comfortable like at home, no way like in a busy big hotel. The breakfast was enough to start the day and the best thing was that you could make a tasty Nespresso also during the day when you came back from your wanderings to cool down. The room was tidy, the bed was comfy and the small laptop provided by the B&B was big plus.

The inn has a lovely breakfast room, where a very nice breakfast (meat, cheese, bread, pastries, fruit) is set up each morning form 8 to 10 am. We loved the self-serve espresso machine (early rising guests are welcome to make a cup of espresso before the start of the official breakfast time).Perhaps most important, our room was very quiet! We slept soundly every night. Masimo and the other staff members are lovely and helpful. They always made sure we had what we needed at breakfast and were very helpful in directing us to a bus route that would take us to Campo di Fiori. The inn is within walking distance of the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and a few notable churches (such as San Pietro in Vincoli). It is also within easy walking distance of the Cavour underground station. We had a great lunch at Cavour 313, which is also just a short walk from the inn.

Inn Urbe amply met my main requirement of having updated, modern, comfortable décor - it was a place we wanted to come back to after a long day of sight seeing. The cozy room enabled us to wind down on the last night of our trip, spending a few comfortable hours lounging in the room watching Sky TV's English channels and surfing the (free) WiFi. Truly, this B&B's main focus is the comfort of guests: reasonable prices in the mini bar (i.e. water was 50 cents - they are not trying to gouge prices), tablet computer in every room, free pastries coffee/tea machine in the common area, the aforementioned English TV channels and free WiFi. The proprietresses were incredibly nice, leaving us a breakfast in the mini-bar fridge since we had to depart for our flight earlier than the front desk/breakfast opened.Something to be mindful of: this is not a traditional hotel, but a B&B-type place, a feature of which is that the front desk is manned only from 8-5. So if you are arriving or departing before or after these times you will have to make specific arrangements. Also, the inn is not staffed at night, so there can be no calls to the front desk at 1am for room service.

Arrive to be met by the owner waiting at the electronic security gates. 1st class welcome and complete briefing of area, attractions, taxi bookings and maps, including places to eat. Leave an hour min for breakfast, once you eat in the gardens you wont want to leave (if they haven't won prizes, Rome is unjust). Rooms large, clean and very nice. All amenities and staff spot on.

Waiting for us when we arrived. - Clean/immaculate - Beautiful garden, nice patio (so nice to have in Rome) - Large rooms with high ceilings and windows. The bed was great. Sometimes a challenge to find in Italy - Great wifi - Great A/C - Extra little amenities - shared little kitchenette to store food/snack - Lovely Italian character - Close enough to everything in Rome if you want to walk (~30min to Piazza Navona for a fit walker), or an easy bus/tram ride. Bus and tram are 2min from the villa - Far enough away to take a nice break from the chaos - Great restaurants nearby - Value: the price is great for what you get - Safe - Tasty little breakfast with toast/pastry/cereal/yogurt/fruit/cappuccino. Silvio accommodated for my partner who is celiac. Do not expect bacon and eggs.CONS: - We had to leave - I have run out of time to write more positive commentsWe stayed four nights at Villa Matissa.

British Airways was late and so we missed our connection from LHR to FCO, which caused a two hour delay for our (much later) arrival.Silvio was very responsive in re-arranging our pickup at the airport, and greeting us well past normal check-in.He took time to get us familiar with with the Villa, and with how to get around Rome. It was easy to see all the sites in Rome from the Villa. Having said that, we were very happy to explore Trastevere as well. We found ourselves very happy with the quaint shops, and streets packed with wonderful restaurant choices in Trastevere.We started each morning with a wonderful breakfast and coffee at the hotel, then full days of sightseeing (with taxi arrangements by Silvio - if needed- to ensure being able to meet our 8am Vatican tour), and then back to the comfort of Trastevere and Villa Matissa. If you are new to Rome, I highly recommend the Villa.Thanks Silvio for a wonderful time. [Should you want an E Ticket adventure, full of wonderful views and sites, buy a 1.50 euro ticket at the tobacco shop by the camera store, then get on the 115 bus. It will loop you back to the hotel. All I can say is .. jump on, quickly find a seat or something to hold onto firmly, and be ready for the ride of your life.

He lives on the property and is available at all times. He is also reachable via Whatsapp.He suggested us some really good Italian restaurants in Trastavere.He was there to receive us when we arrived and showed us the place.Silvio provided us with city maps & brochures. He also gave a brief guide on the city and its main attractions.Location:Bus stops just outside the villa gate.Since the location is just off the main road, it's not noisy & quiet peaceful.Trastevere is a really good place for authentic Italian experience, food and wine. It is walk-able & very pleasant in the evenings to enjoy a real Italian evening. Most of the attractions are just a bus ride away.Breakfast:Variety is sufficient enough. Cornflakes & milk, coffee/cappuccino, croissant/cake/bread, yogurt & fruit, bread/butter/jamOn the day we had to leave early, Silvio was very accommodating and provided us with breakfast at 7.30 amNormal breakfast timings are from 8 - 10 am.All in all, we really enjoyed our stay.

Beautiful garden where you can have your breakfast or take a bottle of wine. We will definitely return here if in Rome again. I can't recommend it enough. Thanks Silvano for making it so special.

477,"Where to start on this great find ?!!Silvio & Monica are the perfect hosts - there to help when needed, and really good with taxis, transport & ""how to get there on foot"" instructions. Perfect.In a lovely setting, this small hotel feels like an oasis in the city. A very short walk from the street life in Trastevere, and only a few more minutes across the Tiber and into the old city itself.This is probably the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in, but still with a relaxed feel to use the place inside and out as you wish. Lovely spacious rooms with plenty of storage and a really, really good shower room. Many regular changes of towels and bedding was a welcome touch.Breakfast was a limited selection of coffee, cereals, pastries & fruit juice made to order, with everything being extremely fresh.There is a small upper covered terrace for drinks & relaxing, plus plenty of space around the building and garden to sit outside and drink their pretty good house wine.Security is very good.","May 17, 2016","9    Villa Matissa

478,"We stayed at the Amalfi hotel for 3 nights over the last week (end of June 2019), check in was straight forward, reception is manned 24/7 and the hosts were all lovely. The hotel is very traditional, really beautiful and was great to stay at. The rooms are air conditioned and clean, they are a little on the small side but this wasn’t an issue for us as we only used it for showering and sleeping. The hotel breakfast is basic but does the job before a big day out! Rooms were cleaned and towels changed daily. Reception also organised our transfer back to the airport which was great.The hotel is a short walk from the Colosseum, and around 20/25 minutes to walk to the Pantheon and Trevi Fountain. The hotel will call taxis for you and they arrive within minutes. We visited the colosseum through City Wonders which was £50 but well worth the money! Same tour company for the Vatican but for us it wasn’t as enjoyable as it was ridiculously busy during the tour which isn’t the company’s fault, it’s just one of those things. My main advice would be to definitely book with a tour company for the main sites, don’t go on the day and queue as the lines were crazy but due to pre-booking with a tour company we went straight into both venues without queuing which was great.The hotel was in a good location and near to lots of bars, restaurants, shops etc. The neighbourhood felt safe and was clean. Two good pubs nearby are Falls Road and Druids Den. The hotel is also just round the corner from Basillica Papale Di Santa Maria Maggiore which is free to enter and definitely worth a visit. Overall the hotel was perfect for a city break, would definitely stay again if I came to Rome. ","June 28, 2019","10    Amalfi Hotel

Just a short walk from the Colesseum and the other main sights. We were worried about being so close to a church with the bells and other noises, but with the windows closed the glazing kept the place exceptionally quiet. We could even hardly hear the Rome Pride march going past directly beneath our window!

It was no more than a 10 minute walk and found a door into an exquisitely decorated hotel. Painted with murals it was beautiful. Staff were so welcoming and showed me to a beautiful single room again with murals painted into the ceiling with a tiny court yard with table and chairs. Complimentary breakfast was included each morning with bread eggs and pastries. Hotel was in walking distance to Colosseum and forum. Close buy to good restaurants and bars.

The location is in fact quite good, close to the Termini rail station and a block from Santa Maria Maggiore. But there are lots of hotels in the area, and our experience was not up to the norm for a 3 star. There is no lobby to speak of, the room key was a charming old key, and the elevator barely fit two people, but these are not serious issues in my view. The room was quite small, and had the distinct taint of mould -- not enough to keep us from spending the one night we'd booked, but noticeable. The staff were pleasant, though did not have to do anything in particular. For the same price we could have had a room in a 4 star hotel a block away.

Very friendly staff, especially the non-English speaking waitress at breakfast who made a flower out of a napkin! Good location and within 15 mins walk from most attractions in Rome, plus Termini train station only 5-10 mins walk away. Rooms are a little small but have everything you need. Road outside quite busy so best to close window at night - air conditioning can only be used if really hot though (A Rome thing) so be aware that rooms can get hot at night. Great view of the Basilica from the window. Comfy bed and all kept very clean - really liked the fresco on the ceiling too which are different in every room.

One caveat - when we were there, the a/c was not yet operational for the season. This was not a problem in general as we could open the window to let the cool air in. Unfortunately, our room faced the street side so we were not able to keep the windows open because of the noise. With windows closed, the room was quiet, but got a tad warm.

The staff at Amalfi were welcoming and friendly and there are not enough thank yous for making our trip so special.On the day of our anniversary they presented us with a bottle of prosecco and a cream cake.Breakfast was delicious and the lady who cooked and made sure we had everything we needed was lovely.Thank you once again for a lovely trip and will definitely return,"October 13, 2018","10    Amalfi Hotel

513,"I generally don't stay near train stations. Hotel Amalfi is less than a 10 minute walk from the main station, Termini. It is clean and comfortable. You can easily take the bus or subway, or walk to important sites and sights. I am a light sleeper, but the quality of the windows kept the room quiet. Breakfast was fine. One outstanding feature of this hotel is the staff. They are extremely nice and helpful. Francesco at the front desk gave us very good restaurant recommendations. The woman managing breakfast went to the bakery around the corner to buy a whole wheat croissant at my wife's request. How often does that happen? We paid about $200 for the room. It is a very good choice at this price point. From what i saw in my web search, to get a higher quality room in a better hotel would require spending $300.","October 10, 2018","10    Amalfi Hotel

514,"Amalfi is a nice little hotel located across from St. Maria Maggiore & in 15 min walk from the Colosseum & 10 min walk from Termini train station. The staff is very pleasant & helpful. We stayed there for two night before our cruise. While the room was small, it was cute & clean. We didn't have any issues with taking a shower as we had hot water (I saw many complains about hot water & AC in Rome's hotels) & AC was very good. We didn't buy breakfast at the hotel as there are plenty of restaurants around & we wanted to have breakfast at different places. The location is very convenient - we even walked to Vatican on Sunday to hear Pope;s Sunday prayer. We didn't use taxis but we used subway - buy subway tickets at tobacco stores not at subway stations. One ticket is 1.5 EUR and very often ticketing machines at subways don't have/give changes. We walked to Termini with our luggage as we took a train to Civitavecchia/port. It was 1+ hr ride for 5.10 EUR per person. We stored our luggage at the hotel on the departure day while we took a walk to Colosseum/St Maria Maggiore/etc.","October 8, 2018","10    Amalfi Hotel

516,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. From what I could gather this seems like a family owned property, reminded me a lot of a similar hotel we stayed in Paris years ago. It is very clean and nicely decorated in period style. The room was very small as I expected, but we made due. The bathroom was comfortable and had all amenities, soap and towels were provided and abundant. The room was very clean with AC and the window had the noise insulation window sash, so the street noise was not heard. Breakfast was plenty, it had all the basics and clean and set up very nicely. What made this hotel a pleasure was the staff. In all cases every person was so helpful and welcoming. The housekeeper was such a sweetheart, we felt like we were in someone's house! She wanted to make sure we had all we needed in the room as well at the breakfast. We had an early morning tour and they opened up for us so we could grab some food before running out the door. If any suggestion could be made is I would have the breakfast open earlier like at 7AM because there are so many tours in Rome that start at 7;30 and there is no way you can have some coffee and travel to the tour destination.The location is also good, close to Santa Maria Maggiore. It's not as convenient to the Vatican but very close to the Forum and the Colosseum. But in Rome you can't be close to everything and for our purposes on this trip, this property worked out very well. There are a lot of places to eat close by and the area is easy to walk to the the train station as well as Via Nazionale. This was not my first trip to Rome so I based my choice of hotel on what we were planning on doing.We were very pleased. Thank you for all your work on our behalf Hotel Amalfi!!","September 26, 2018","10    Amalfi Hotel

The room and patio didn't offer much of a view, but it didn't bother me, with downtown Rome right outside. The bed was comfortable, and they did accommodate my request for a softer bed, with some extra padding, which I was thankful for.Hotel staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.

Everyone we met was super friendly and helpful. The breakfast was probably the best hotel breakfast we've had and we appreciated the free bottle of wine in our room. The room was spotlessly clean and quiet, and the bed was very comfortable. The location was also great, as it's close to many restaurants and a short walk from the Colosseum.

525,"First of all, I want to thank the Amalfi staff for their excellent hospitality and helpfulness. Very nice and patient people! Several advantages should be mentioned in regards to this hotel:1. Being in central Rome, it’s walking distance, or close Metro service, to several major sites (i.e., the Colosseum and Roman Forum in particular)2. It’s walking distance to Termini, the major train station in Rome. You can pretty much go anywhere from there (including Fiumicino Airport, FCO)3. The breakfast at the hotel is very good. Excellent cappuccinos! The seating, however, can be limited 4. The housekeeping staff did great work. Much appreciated…5. Visited Rome in July and it was pretty hot. The hotel’s AC seems to be ample6. On the negative side, you will need a special adaptor to charge your phone and camera. The front desk was kind enough to loan me one7. The rooms are nice (especially the bathrooms) but small and tight (probably all comparable hotels in the area would have the same problem). You should pack very lightly. In my room there was one cabinet for hanging clothes but not too much room for anything else. The desk and nightstands did not have drawers. No alarm clock or American style coffee maker. The bed was okay but a little on the firm side Overall a very pleasant experience; would highly recommend the Amalfi to a friend. I hope to stay there again in the future…V.

Lovely warm welcome when we checked in and our room was perfectly sized for us with a teenage boy (they seem to take up a lot of room!)We arrived in the early afternoon and room was ready. We were also able to stay an hour longer for check out, which was so kind. Hotel is wonderfully located for exploring on foot or by metro. We walked a lot and saw the Trevi Fountain; Spanish Steps; Colosseum and lots of other places. Also plenty of restaurants around and the hotel are very happy to make recommendations. We tried one of them and it was indeed excellent. Breakfast was plentiful and was quite tasty. Filled us up the one day we had breakfast there.I’d absolutely recommend this hotel, it’s great value and wonderful service and best nights sleep I’ve had in a long while!Should I be lucky enough to come back to Rome, I would definitely look to stay here.

528,"We stayed at Amalfi Hotel for 4 night with a party of eight during May 24-May 28, prior to our cruise trip. The staff was very helpful by making airport pick-up arrangement and local restaurant reservation for us before our arrival. Additionally, they gave us all sorts of local advices at the best they could. The breakfast lady is funny and friendly. She did her job well by making sure everyone eats well and happy. The only issue we had with the property is that one of the room that we occupied had some strong odor. We made a complaint to the owner but there was nothing he could do due to the busy weekend. Odor issue was largely mitigated after the compliant and we left 2 days later. The hotel location is very convenient. The hotel is close to the train station by 5 mins walk, Hop-On and Off bus stop (Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore), and local supermarket and drugstore. It takes about 30 minutes leisure walk to Spanish steps and about 20 minutes to Colosseum. It should be noted that nearby the hotel, it has pretty good local stores for shopping. Nothing extravagant but you can find some pretty good quality “Made In Italy” shoes, umbrebella and clothing.

534,"""Wonderful"" is the word which best describes the first port of call of our recent European trip at the QT Suites & Apartments! Our courtyard-facing room was quiet, spacious, super-comfortable, and beautifully designed. It was equipped with everything we needed after our long haul flight from Australia, including iron/ironing board for our crumpled clothing. Diego was a wonderful host, helping us feel totally at home and ensuring our every need was catered for. His breakfast trays were simply amazing - artistically arranged, full of fresh produce and local treats, and tailored beautifully to our vegetarian requirements. We never had to eat again until dinner time! Diego's restaurant recommendation upon our arrival lateish on a Sunday night proved to be the best meal we had in Rome.The QT's location was also wonderful..... A relatively quiet street which led directly (about one minute's walk) to the Spanish Steps. The Trevi Fountain was only about five minutes away by foot. A little further afield, but still well within walking distance, were the Galleria Borghese, Piazza del Popolo and other major tourist attractions of Rome. All in all, a wonderful base from which to explore a wonderful city.Thank you Diego for helping make our time in Rome truly memorable.","August 14, 2018","11    QT Suites & Apartments

He was extremely communicative, helpful, caring, and attentive both before and during our stay. The location of this hotel is PERFECT - super close to all the sight seeing that Rome has to offer. We walked to everything from our hotel. There is also a subway station right next to the hotel in case we didn't want to walk. Our room was EXACTLY as described in the photos and narrative. In fact, I would have to say it was even BETTER! What made this place most special however was the personal touch. You can tell that Diego cares about his business and his customers. He put in extra effort to ensure that our stay was perfect. He even gave us his personal phone number and was available to us 24 hours a day.Breakfast in the morning was fantastic and customizable. The sheets and the towels were high quality. The windows did a very good job blocking the noise outside the apartment. The air conditioning was digital and worked well.

537,We recently stayed at QT suites for a short break and found the accommodation to be absolutely faultless - the room we were given was large and airy and very well equipped. Clearly a lot of thought has gone into the design of the apartments with everything you could possibly need provided to ensure you have a comfortable stay. QT suites is located very close to the Spanish steps and Spagna Metro station so is an excellent base for exploring the central part of Rome. We were given the rear room (heyschia?) at QT which has a small balcony overlooking a courtyard and was a lovely peaceful retreat after a busy day in the city - listening to the birds it is hard to imagine you are only minutes away from the thousands of tourists and busy traffic.Diego is the perfect host and ensures you have everything you need to make your stay enjoyable. The generous breakfasts provided are a perfect start to a busy day exploring Rome and delivered direct to your door at a time of your choosing which is a nice touch. Whilst we were on holiday we celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary - we did not make any mention of this to Diego however our anniversary cards must have been noted since we returned to our room to find a heart shaped cake which had been baked by Diego's friend Francesca - a lovely gesture which we will long remember and which clearly shows Diego has genuine interest in making his guests feel special We had never stayed in an apartment before this trip but the QT suites is one the best accommodations we have ever stayed in - a real home from home!If you are reading this Diego many thanks again for making our stay in Rome so perfect!!!,"May 28, 2018","11    QT Suites & Apartments

The room is very nice, quiet, with a small balcony overlooking other "" palazzi"". The bed and pillows are very comfortable. We were unhappy with the breckfast solution ( a bar nearby did not have good standards according to our wishes), and Diego provided us with the perfect solution : breckfast in bed!!!!.We wish him the best of luck. He deserves it for all the responsibility and dedication he brings to this job.","October 12, 2016","11    QT Suites & Apartments

547,"My fiancee and I stayed here in August 2016 and absolutely loved it. The location is right next to the spanish steps and central to all sights. The room was lovely and spacious and the breakfast at the local cafe was a nice touch. Complimentary coffee in room and the mini bar prices are reasonable as well. Upon our arrival in Rome, our luggage was lost and Diego went above and beyond to help us retrieve it back. He drew up a map of the main shopping areas to buy essentials, he provided us with an italian mobile and sim card with topped up as well as his personal mobile number for anything we needed. When our luggage hadnt arrived the next day, Diego called the airline himself and spent most of the day chasing it down, not because we asked but because he wanted to make sure we had our luggage bag and the best time in Rome. We couldnt have asked for a better owner and if it wasnt for Diego I'm pretty sure we wouldnt have had our luggage by the end of the trip. When Diego realised it was my partners birthday he also surprised us with a complimentary bottle of bubbles in our room. Again unexpected but a lovely surprise. All the little personal touches at QT suites made it a wonderful stay and i'd highly recommend it to others, we couldnt fault anything.","September 30, 2016","11    QT Suites & Apartments

548,"QT apartments are situated close to the Spanish steps and central to all of the key tourist areas of Rome .The rooms are spacious ,furnished immaculately and are a real showpiece .Great place to relax after walking Rome .The owner Diego makes you feel very special and with 3 apartments you will receive great personalised service .Nothing seems to be too much of a bother . The breafast down the road at a local cafe is a real treat and allows you to experience the local Roman culture .However if you are there on the weekend the Sunday breakfast prepared by Diego is fresh and out of this world .having been to Rome many times QT apartments are a real find and it will be my place to stay for future trips .Also men and women do yourselves a favour and visit the Aqua di Palma boutique shop at the bottom of the Spanish steps","July 21, 2016","11    QT Suites & Apartments

550,"Rome was the last city in our trip in Europe. My wife and I arrived Rome very late at night after several hours drive from Florence. The owner of QT Suites Diego waited for us until we arrived, he took us to the room and kindly introduced everything inside the room and let us know the arrangement of breakfast and some attractions nearby (the location of QT Suites was very good). We were very impressed as it was really late at night.The room was clean and tidy, it was a very comfortable place to sleep.In the morning, a very rich breakfast was served inside the room, the food was more than enough! After the breakfast, Diego told us where we could return our car, where we could visit, how we could get those places, he searched all information for us! Because QT Suites did not serve the breakfast during weekend, Diego clearly told us the arrangement for breakfast which was served in a restaurant just one minute from QT Suites, everything was properly planned and arranged.As our flight leaving Rome was a late afternoon one, Diego let us occupied the room few hours more and arranged a taxi to take us to the airport.The QT Suites was/is/will be a perfect place to stay in Rome because of a delicated owner, Diego, who managed QT Suites well and took an excellent care of visitors, most importantly, he was kind, polite and attentive, his attitude was very positive.Diego was the best owner I had ever met.

551,"So happy to have found this hidden gem only a couple of minutes away fromthe Spanish Steps. The QT Suites are situated in a beautiful building. We were greeted by the owner, Diego and he was the perfect host. The building has a lovely old fashioned lift or you can take the old marble stairs to the second floor. The suite we stayed in was absolutely beautiful and everything is finished to a very high standard. There is everything you could wish for, comfortable bed with loads of pillows, lots of wardrobe space, double glazing, a beautiful umbrella to borrow ( but hopefully not needed), full ironing board and iron, a proper full sized hairdryer that you can plug in, an excellent coffee machine with complimentary coffee, a full mini bar with snacks at reasonable prices, nice toiletries and a good shower. Breakfast is served in a cafe around the corner and you can choose from different options, scrambled egg, bacon, croissants, pastries etc. It was nice to have breakfast in a local place with predominantly Italian people popping in for their morning coffee. Everything was on our door step and the place is very centrally situated. We walked everywhere and did not have to use public transport once. We decided to get a taxi to and from the airport and it is a flat rate of €48. We had the most wonderful time and would like to thank Diego for being so helpful. I would totally recommend a stay here- it was wonderful!!","October 25, 2015","11    QT Suites & Apartments

554,"The whole stay was excellent. Fabrizio and the team are really helpful. On arrival late on Monday, we were given a map of Rome with some tourist hotspots to check out, and spoken to on how to get there. We speak very minimal Italian but the team were excellent at communicating with us and explaining everything wonderfully in english. The hotel will drop you to a train station near by (Labaro) for free And also pick you up later that evening. Also giving you advice and help along the way (told us about being a public holiday so how to get back etc...). The team are friendly and always want to ensure the guests are happy. We arrived late at night on Monday and they ordered us a takeaway pizza and rang our room when it arrived so we could collect and pay which we really appreciated. Breakfast has a good selection and the croissants are excellent. Flaky and delicious! The room was a nice size with a comfy bed and a good bathroom. Shower was powerful and a good size. Room has a mini-bar in which we didn’t use but it was useful to have if required! TV in the room comes with Netflix on so we could log in and watch some shows late evening when we got back to the hotel which was great as well. Cleanliness of the hotel was top notch. They also have a gym area where you can go at any time and use for free. We will be recommending that people stay here when they go to Rome.

555,"You really cannot fault the service at this hotel. The owners and other staff are so helpful. You can read previous reviews about the shuttle service to and from the train station; it is an excellent service and the train is easy to use and only 15 minutes to get you to the centre.The hotel provides a varied buffet breakfast, if you have dietary needs let them know, they really look after you. The coffee is good too. We moved from a suite which was not good for us after the first night, the room they allocated to us was large, light (balconies on two sides) and comfortable; with a spa bath and shower over it. There are safes and mini bars in the rooms.Although the hotel is very close to a motorway the noise in the rooms is not intrusive. We live in the middle of nowhere and noise for us is a problem. It was not a problem here. I am not sure whether it would be possible to get an undisturbed night’s sleep in the centre of Rome; it seems as if the ambulances drive around in circles nonstop with their sirens on.","October 27, 2018","12    Hotel Castle

They arranged some takeaway food to be delivered as well.Nothing is a problem for the staff here. The rooms are large clean and comfy beds. They have a big pool to relax in after touring or spend the day at. The hotel will drop you at the railway station and pick you up on your return home. Easy access from the station to all tourist spots. There is a restaurant within walking distance which offers great choices. Breakfast was plentiful. If you are visiting Rome this is a great place to stay at for a reasonable rate with great access provided by the hotel. They even have the train tickets for you.

560,"The hotel is a relatively quiet and roomy one. It offers good experience that certainly values its price. And the service there was probably the best in my trip.The breakfast was tasty as well as the drinks they offered. The room was quite spacious, and the facilities were better then the average.We checked in at the dinner time. We were really staving at the time but the hotel did not have a restaurant for dinner and it was raining heavily outside so it is not possible for us to find a nearby restaurant. The reception then suggested us to order some take-out and gave us some menus of the nearby restaurant. Since I am not able to speak Italian, the reception kindly helped me to order the food(by phone calls) that we have selected on the menu, and sent it directly to our rooms, with plates, knifes, folks and a friendly smile. I had no cash on me, so the reception also paid the bill of the food for me, adding the fees to the check out charge, which was also helpful.When leaving, the hotel gave us a chance to take a free rider from the hotel(not sure about this), an sent us directly to the train station with free of charge. This saved us at least an hour to walk there with heavy luggages.I strongly recommend it.","April 3, 2018","12    Hotel Castle

Me and my girlfriend stayed there for 6 nights and the stuff-owners there where kind enough to take us to the station by car every morning and take us from there at the evenings.

566,"Three night stay for a mini break to Rome. Try as I must I really won't be able to write the review this incredible hotel deserves. Offers free shuttle service between local station and hotel at any time of day up to the last train. Just phoned hotel and only took a few minutes for their car to arrive. Sells train tickets which enables you to travel on train, bus and tram. Makes life simple if you don't speak Italian to try and buy a ticket. Reception staff day and night were always incredibly accommodating with our every request.The room was lovely and the bed was at least a Queen size. We didn't see the maids as left by 10am and returned late each night. Our room was tidy, towels and toiletries refreshed daily. We were on the ground floor which was handy as I have a walking stick. Continental breakfast served in ample amounts and very tasty. In the lobby there's the Reception area and also a bar that sells alcohol, coffee and offers bar snacks. Also on offer are copious amounts of small boiled sweets. This hotel is 10 stops on the train which sounds a lot, but goes very quickly as the stops are very close together. Took 25 mins from hotel to Flamino station. Make sure on your return journey to the hotel that you board the Montebello train and press the orange button by the doors, the station before Larbaro as the train will not stop unless button pressed. A lovely family run hotel with a friendly little dog. As we've thrown a coin into the Trevi fountain we shall be returning. We will definitely return to this hotel. Should be a FIVE STAR HOTEL.

The hotel is no where near close to any of the major major attractions (ie: Colosseum, Trevi Fountain). I don't think walking to the attractions would be good either, maybe a few hours of walking? The hotel is less than 5 mins by car to Labaro Station, which any of the hotel workers will gladly drop you off to. With a simple call to the hotel front desk, they pick you up at night from the station. We also we're able to purchase train tickets from the front desk. By train to the city center, about 10-15 min depending if a lot of people are coming on/off along the stops, convinient we thought.Every morning they do a breakfast you buffet which was the best we had compared to all our other hotels. Plus free unlimited cappuccinos made at the espresso bar. I believe their brothers that we mostly interacted with that ran things, who also were very informative about attractions and walking amongst the city center.We also arranged with the hotel for airport transportation which was so convenient. The neighborhood around the hotel is a quite and cute with very few shops and a few cafes we saw on our first day but we preferred the hotel's espressos bar.Overall, we thought the hotel was a good base to come home to after a full day of adventuring thru Rome.

If you have to get a cab do it, but just saying you can save money by arranging before hand. Again, we chose this based on the reviews. We were blown away. This place is not city centre, but you dont want to be. It is busy, for some it can be too busy. Therefore, staying at this hotel was just a nice way to bring your day to a close. This hotel is family run and they will go out of their way to make sure your stay is nothing but pleasant. From arrival all the staff were so attentive and nice. They spoke English and had maps, tickets to the train station, etc. TRUST ME, get tickets ahead of time whenever possible to all major attractions because lines are just long. Specially if you are traveling with kids or want to maximize your day.They also take you to and from the train station which is vital. We bought the train tickets that were for 72 hrs and you can hop on and off as many times as you want within those 72 hrs. Kids under 10 are free to ride which is nice. The rooms are nice and clean with a great view. The pool is also very nice. Breakfast is also nice and plentiful. If you dont like pastries I suggest you open your mind and try them because they are just delicious. We stayed for about a week and had a great positive experience. The bar is also open so makes it convenient if you want a drink and you can have pizza delivered to your room, which is nice.

578,"Amazing place, the service is second to none, and all the family who run this hotel are lovely and do everything they can to help you and make your stay pleasant. The swimming pool is in lovely surroundings. The deluxe room is very nice indeed and well furnished. The rooms are quiet. The area is a bit out of the centre of room, BUT DONT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF. The train tickets are very cheap and can be bought at the hotel. A free car will take you to and from the train station quickly and in comfort. The money you will save by being in a nicer and safer hotel rather than the centre of Rome makes this a no brainer. We will be sure to return when next visiting the eternal city.","May 16, 2015","12    Hotel Castle

579,"I love this hotel, the location, the staff, they were all very nice to me and I felt welcome. The staff are all helpful and speak a fair amount of English. It's not exactly in the city centre, as you have to take a small train to get to the hotel and vice versa, however you are picked up at the train station by the hotel staff and they drop you to the station from the hotel. If you booked tours like I did, they can organise a taxi to pick you up at any time, of course you will pay a bit more, but this is more than compensated for in what you pay to stay at the hotel. Breakfast is also included in the cost and you have a wide variety to choose from. Once you get off the train you are smack in the city centre and can walk to almost everything. If you plan to stay out late at night, taxis are always available to take you to the hotel, so keep in mind the last train times. The front desk also sells train tickets so you don't need to purchase at the station.","May 11, 2015","12    Hotel Castle

580,"We just checked out of Hotel Castle and could not wait to write this review. Upon arrival we were a bit concerned that the hotel is not in the center of Rome but after checking in we knew we had made the best decision on where to stay. This is a family owned business and the family places high importance on guest satisfaction. Once we checked in we were given a map with all highlighted must-see sights without even asking! They also let us know that they drive guests to the nearest train station to get into the city - extremely convenient! Hotel Castle also has a connection with a local company for rides to both of the airports. They even sent us an email a week before arrival to confirm and printed our flight itineraries. Great experience! Clean, convenient and great value! You won't regret staying here.","April 8, 2015","12    Hotel Castle

581,"Stayed at hotel castle from 20th February for 3 nights with my partner for my 30th birthday. Hotel emailed me before my stay to see if I wanted to arrange transport with a 3rd party - this was a great help as it took the hassle out of getting to the hotel (guy waiting with your name at arrivals) and was fairly priced at 45euros each way. Greeted at the hotel by very friendly guy who promptly booked is in and gave us a brief overview of the main sites and transport links in Rome. I was a little worried as this hotel is a little out of the city but the staff were lovely and would take you to and from the station in an instant! The room we stayed in was lovely and spacious, spotlessly clean with a power shower and two (!) balconies!! Over the course of the weekend the various members of staff we met were very helpful, welcoming and nothing was too much bother. Breakfast was traditional European and plentiful with juice, fruit, sweet pastries, cereal, toast, ham, cheese etc...few downsides but nothing serious...wifi signal was poor in our room, not a deal breaker but would have been nice to have, pillows were a little thin (even with the extra provided) and not many places to eat near hotel if you fancied a night out of the hustle and bustle if Rome (but not the hotels fault). All in all had a fantastic stay in hotel castle. Hotel is definitely stand out by the service provided by the friendly (and very good looking!) front of house staff! Even when my fiancé forgot the room key as we left for the airport! they were very understanding and arranged to pick up the key from lost property (so sorry about that!). Would definitely recommend the hotel to all for a reasonably priced, hassle free stay in Rome :)","March 22, 2015","12    Hotel Castle

In the morning I drove into Rome at rush hour and it took me about 40 minutes; not badIt is easy to find ; room are comfortable; owners and staff are friendly and helpful. The good news is now there is a nice new restaurant near by that can be reached by walk. Food is excellent and staff are friendly and professional.

584,"I was backpacking through Europe with my sister and Rome happen to be our last stop. I'm so glad I did the research and booked our hotel stay here. I found the service and hotel stay to be just as the positive comments have described it to be in the TripAdvisor comments.We were a little worried about it being outside of the city center but, once we got there the 15-20 minute train ride from Labaro station to the Flaminio station (city center of Rome where Piazza del Popolo is located) wasn't a problem at all. Having someone drive you to and from Labaro station helped a lot and made travel less stressful. Hours of free transportation between hotel and train station were from 7:00-12:00 and 19:00-23:00. Check with the hotel for up to date hours of operation on this free and incredible service they provide. If you don't mind staying out of the city center of Rome and taking a train into Rome, I would definitely recommend staying here for service, cleanliness, and price.There were some minor miscommunication I ran into with pick up from Roma Termini station to the hotel but, it was resolved....I called the hotel and I found the driver and was driven to the hotel. I also arranged for their private driver/taxi service to the airport and it was fine.This was my first time to Rome and staying at this hotel have left a positive experience as part of my travel. I would definitely stay here again if I visit Rome again. The hotel price is very reasonable, the rooms were always clean, the variety in morning breakfast is decent (my cup of cappuccino, banana, yogurt, and toast w/butter left me happy and ready to start my morning exploration of Rome), the staff were very accommodating and professional.Thank you Fabrizio, Stefano, Maximo, and the rest of the Hotel Castle family and staff for the amazing stay! Rome is such a lovely city and Italy is a beautiful country. I hope to visit again in the future!","November 9, 2014","12    Hotel Castle

585,Stayed for 3 nights October 14 - 16. We booked this hotel due to the reviews on tripadvisor. We were not disappointed the reviews were totally correct.The family run place was exactly what was needed after a long day of touring. The two sons are as helpful as can be. They got us tickets for a guided tour of the vatican on their computer and printed out the tickets for us. We did not have to wait in line and we knew what time to get there for the guided tour. They also got us a cab very early in the morning so we could go see the pope on Wednesday for his general audience. We needed to get there very early for a good seat to see the pope. We were able to get very close and he passed right by us.The room was very clean. The breakfast was plentiful and delicious. We had a car and the parking is free another plus for this hotel.We will not hesitate to stay here the next time we visit Rome.Thank you for a great stay.,"October 26, 2014","12    Hotel Castle

586,"Hotel Castle is Family owned and run and as a result it is spotless with teh attention to clients you rarely get at larger hotels especially in the city. Its a 15 minute rail ride from Rome so bear that in mind, if you want to step out of the Hotel into bustling Rome this is not for you. However they drive you to the nearest rail station; Drop off between 0730 and 12:00 and collect you in the evening between 1800 and 2300, yes the driver is just waiting there for you....he just waits there for groups to come back (its a 3 min car ride back to the hotel). Moreover they sell day or weekend tickets for the trains and will book attraction tickets on-line - we paid the €16 each and skipped the queues at the Colosseum.Breakfast is Buffet style; cold meats, lots of pastries, fruit and yoghurt and wonderful wonderful coffee.As with many European hotels they like a hard mattress....a few carafes of red wine in Rome's city centre put pay to that. There is also a pool which I imagine in the height of summer is a relief. They will order food deliveries for you if you feel the need to escape and eat at the hotel and they have a small bar for beers wines when you return.We chose to have the driver collect us from the airport (Fiumincino) at €45 each way its a bit of cost but well worth saving the effort of a train journey into Rome then out to Labaro (local stop). especially when you are only there for 3 days. All in all a fantastic hotel and will definitely stay there again!!","October 25, 2014","12    Hotel Castle

587,"As a couple we finalised this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and it turned out to be a great choice!! Here is why we liked it:- great ownership: Seems like a family run place and they really want to be on the top.- fair room size for Rome - we stayed in room 133 for one night on 11 oct. - location is ok but they make it ""good"" with there pick and drop service: We were dropped and picked up from the Labaro train station which is close to the hotel. A train from Labaro goes to the Central Rome area. Someone is waiting for you at Labaro to take you back to the hotel when you come back in the evening.- pick up service from the airport: we were picked up from the airport in a cab and they charged a fair price of 45 euros for the distance. The cab turned out to be a merc.- attention to detail in the hotel:a comb, slippers, tooth brush, shampoo, body wash, soap...nearly everything you need... Though a moisturiser was missed- neat and clean bedroom and area around.- great communication: quick response to all email queries sent - very helpful: we had an early morning 5:30 am checkout which meant missing our breakfast. They accommodated this by letting us have breakfast a day earlier. Also, all our interactions were met with a smile and very helpful inputs. - free toffees everywhere: my husband had a bad throat and he really liked them being around and used quite a few- value for money: given the service and hospitality, this is a GREAT value for money Summary: will I stay there again? yes. Personalised service is what we really like and these guys know how to give that and keep folks on a vacation happy..... What else to ask for when on a vacation...","October 15, 2014","12    Hotel Castle

588,"The one thing that worried me about this hotel were the reviews about how far away it was. The great thing is, your only a 20 minute train ride away from the center. The staff will bring you to the train station and be waiting when you get back up to 1100 P.M. If you are going to stay in the center longer, you can get a taxi back.If you do decide to tale the train, plan ahead and make sure you get on the right train. Not really anything negative to say about the stay. The room was smaller but perfect for myself and my wife (room 133). If you gonna stay in Rome for three or more days, book this hotel.

We found the hotel to be extremely helpful and the family who runs it willing to do everything possible to help. They had metro tickets available, helped with tickets to the various sites and even stopped to purchase train tickets for us on our departure. The only downside was the distance from the city (15-20 min by metro) but there was a car and driver available at all times to transport 5 minutes to the metro line which ran from very early morning until 11:00 p.m. Always a driver there at night when we returned. The basic room we had was clean and adequate with a mini fridge. WIFI was great and no charge. No coffeemaker but a wonderful breakfast and coffee downstairs.

Didn't give 5 stars only because the location is a jog from the city center. With the drop off at the train station and navigating the train lines, you can get to the city center in 20-30 minutes. Your day needs to be planned accordingly. Also there aren't a lot of dinner options around the hotel that are in walking distance. All of that is reflected in the price.

We arrived later than planned and beyond their normal shuttle time to the local train station on the first day. After checking in and getting settled, they gladly whisked us off to the local train station anyway. The day was not lost as we exited right at the Coliseum and enjoyed the rest of the day and early evening. The car, as promised was waiting for us when we returned and brought us back to the hotel. BTW, tickets for the rail service sold right at the front desk. (I found the rail here to be the best value in all Italy) Because of the free parking and shuttle service, my vehicle remained unmoved until I checked out. No need to try and navigate the narrow streets of Rome. Breakfast was wonderful at the hotel, drinks at the bar when we returned, even local takeout ordered by the night clerk Davide (hope I got his name right) all make the service here outstanding in my opinion. The pool area and landscaping were very inviting.

Special thanks go to Fabrizio and Attilio for helping us in every regard and the drivers who were waiting for us at the train station every evening to take us to the hotel. I recommend taking the hotel's taxi service from either Termini or the airport. We tried to go by metro/train from Termini but it was too difficult to do. The woman at the Termini information desk was rude and unhelpful and even tried to discourage us from staying at Hotel Castle (""your hotel is not in Rome!""). This is not true, but it is best to take a taxi to the hotel and once there the staff will orient you on how best to travel to Rome and back. The rooms were comfortable, quiet and very clean.

Breakfast is also good with selection of good and hot items. Would reccomend it. Only negative side is that the hotel is not in the centre but there is a metro near by approximately 10 minutes by walk. ,"January 2, 2019","13    Gasometer Urban Suites

It is easy to reach the city, bus stop next to the hotel which takes you straight to the Metro station. Metro's are frequent and very cheap. It took about 45 mins to get from the hotel to the city center. I felt that once you made this trip in the morning you wouldn't make it again in the evening. Normally we would do a days sight seeing and return to the hotel and get showered and changed and head out again. With the Domidea by the time you got back to the Hotel we found we couldn't face going back through the bus and metro again. This may be just us but I wouldn't stay there again.

In addition to the room costs we had to drive to a supermarket to purchase a kettle (no kettles in the room?) plates, mugs, cutlery, a chopping board and knife as advised by a supervisor/manager. We also tried unsuccessfully for some ice but were told we would have to wait until the evening when the bar opens because not one staff member in this hotel can walk behind the bar and fill a bowl of ice.

She seemed to always be there to answer our questions and assist us in anything we needed...we were a party of six in three separate rooms.Our one complaint about the hotel is the location. With the exception of breakfast, there is a limited dining choice nearby. There is a dinner bar buffet, but it is only opened on weekdays. The Chinese buffet next door is ok, but not for every meal (we were there five nights). There are some choices about a one mile walk away, however, for elderly visitors that might not be a feasible option. The hotel is modern, clean, and welcoming. The staff is knowledgable and helpful.

We were cold during our entire stay and got sick. The dinner buffet was empty and we had to go elsewhere at 9pm. Ridiculous. There isn't even tea and coffee in the room.Not even a mug or kettle.The place is an outcamp for the localPolice who are constantly around in droves.

The hotel was quite away out from the Rebbibia metro and it didn't help that the bus service had to detour because of road closures and then when we did catch one of the busses recommended it didn't actually stop at the hotel. My friend and I then had to be told to get on the bus behind which took us so far before being instructed to get off and which direction to follow to the hotel on foot!The room we had was basic but very clean but my biggest negative was there was no kettle for making my normal hot water or a cup of tea/coffee. After a long day of walking it would have been nice to come back to being able to have a nice hot drink.I did ask for a hot water which was kindly provided unfortunately this did not taste very nice (it had a peculiar taste which was very unpleasant). Perhaps not a fault of the hotel, maybe water in Rome?! The water from the drink machine at breakfast was fine!If you're staying at this hotel be prepared for your eyes to be opened by its surroundings as we thought it a very run down area and somewhat dirty (I think we're spoiled in England)! I thought my bed was very comfortable but my friend thought hers was too hard, can't please everyone I suppose!Unfortunately you can't eat at the hotel for an evening meal, we were told to visit next door for food, but the menu was quite pricey for food that didn't appeal.

635,"Reason why I booked this place is because of the many good reviews of customer service!! And that's what this place is!! Exceptional customer service very friendly and inviting!! It makes visiting a foreign country not so foreign if you know what I mean!! Yes it is a little ways from town but they have a bus route right down the road you pay 1.50 Euros and it takes you to the subway which you than you catch the subway using the same ticket straight to the heart of everything!! It's very simple and easy!! And plus side note for all y'all big people out there, I'm a big guy and I hate walking but this was not to bad for me. There is also a little shop/bar like right down the road where you purchase your bus ticket on the same block which stays open 24/7 which of course sells drinks and sandwiches incase you get a little hungry at night or can't sleep so a few shots will remedy your insomnia. One thing is remember to have a little cash in hand as you will not be able to use foreign cards there from my experience. Also before I forget. Additional side not just incase seeing as this place is pretty far from the airport, Iv come to realise that any kinda of shuttle transportation or anything of that nature is super expensive! When you arrive unless you have the money and are willing. Do watch out for individuals at the airport offering their service!! They are a ripoff and can be very convincing with their words and sometimes looks. Haha but iv found that the cheapest way is either call an uber which will still be expensive but not so expensive as the airport shuttles will charge or, you can arrange with the hotel before hand to have them pick you up.. either option is the same price which if I remember correctly is 60 euros one way. Anyways place is nice!! Free breakfast in the morning all you can eat on the first floor, food served is yummy!! well maintained and clean, it's safe as you will come to know, there is police everywhere lol sometimes I think some of them actually stay there as I always see them every hours of the day lounging around haha.. and once again exceptional customer service!!

As it is not mass produced food tasted better ,especially the scrambled eggs.The shuttles to the Rebibia metro station is an added benifial.

It is a good 2.5, 3 star at best. Not sure why it's marked four star. No pool, fitness, or anything extra, very basic and far from the city.

647,"Following raving review of this hotel on Booking.com, I booked this hotel relying on other people' comments. OK, we drove from London as we preferred to do so, rather than fly like all our other holidays. The journey was not 16 hours like the brochures say. Be warned on this, as it also costs an arm and a leg in toll charges and extra fuel as well.We were late for our hotel check-in so we called ahead.We arrived on our day of check in at around mid night. We kept calling the hotel reception asking for directions. Small details like where we were in relation to where we were going would have helped rather than being asked have you passed the Tolls yet. Domidea Hotel is down as 4 Star Hotel. Certainly, it deserves its star rating. Having always stayed in 4 star and above, the hotel has the ambience of a 4 star, in both value and facilities. Reception staff on arrial were very helpful and knowldgeble as well as we needed to save time on deciding on where to go next day. Staff gave us appropriate information in terms, of shuttle bus from hotel to Rebbibea Train Metro Station and sites to visit. The free shuttle from the hotel to the metro station only runs early morning and stops at 09:30. The is a Bus stp round the corner with 2 buses direct to Rebbibea Metro Station. There are 2 buses but not always regular.Breakfast is a typical Mediterrenian Breakfast....not our usual UK fry up. There is tea and plenty of coffee. There seemed to be only one waiter on hand, albeit sufficient for a small hotel. Breakfast consisted mainly of sweet cakes and fruit on the side. There were 4 different types of fresh juices. Plenty of water even to take away.Our only negative about the hotel is that travelling with a baby, our baby needed to have his bottles sterilised and we do this in the microwave. The waiter allowed my Wife to use the common microwave but when one of the reception female memmber found out, we got told off and we stopped. Fortunately we were leaving the next day.There is a Restaurant nearby, Food is Love but it was shut when we were there. There is also a bar and restuarant 777, which aslo was closed. Both closed for summer holidays. Not very helpful that was. We then had to walk in the middle of the night to a nearby restaurant (Tito) which was recommened by hotel staff. The next day, we found it easier to drive there. I will review the restaurant separately.We will be returning to this hotel next year. Overall the hotel is good value for money!","September 1, 2014","14    Domidea Hotel

648,"The title says it all really. Hotel Domidea offers excellent value for money. The rooms are finished to a very good standard and are immaculately cleaned, every day. The service is the real stand our in this hotel though. The staff are warm, approachable and incredibly helpful. Breakfast was fab- a good selection of continental favourites. It would be nice however to have a little more of a hot choice. The only downside to this hotel is it's location. It is a considerable journey from the centre of Rome. Requiring a short walk, a bus and a metro train. Once you get in the routine however, thus is not a problem. I will go out of my way to stay there again. I will probably hire a car next time!

649,"The hotel is in a ""Red light"" district, some distance away from the nearest Metro terminus. We found a distinct lack of places to eat at night other than the odd cafe/bar style food. There was a recommended place next door however most of the menu was crossed off & priced high. The ""free"" mini shuttle bus to the metro was charged for on the final bill!! We found the sights of Rome wonderful ...but watch out for ""pickpockets"" we were robbed of my wallet cash & cards, police said it is common. Taxi drivers say they have no meters & charge almost twice the proper fee to tourists. Be prepared to queue for 2-3 hours to see the Vatican which is miles away from the hotel. Overall the hotel is in an industrial area well away from the centre of Rome so most of the day is spent traveling to & fro on filthy overcrowded graffiti smitten underground systems .On the positive side the most helpful member of staff being the multi lingual barman who was so helpful & knowledgeable (Diran)We would not return to such an out of town place, our nights were spoiled not being able to enjoy evenings in Rome!!!We did loose some clothes too? & if late to your breakfast 8-30am no orange juice or bread left.

650,"This is a modern, very nice hotel but is far removed from most of what you want to see in Rome. I'll base my comparison of this hotel on the American hotels I frequent but that will not figure into the ratings. It's just so that those in America planning a trip have some idea what to expect.I stayed here in March and it was the first hotel my wife and I stayed in of the 4 throughout Italy and this was my favorite based solely on the hotel room. The room was large, like suite large, with a nice sitting area, fairly large bathroom with a great shower, nice bed (although a bit hard for the wifes taste), free wi-fi that you could access in the room and the only hotel that allowed us to set the air conditioning in the room. Breakfast was typical continental for Italy which was prociutto, cheese, bread, and a wide selection of pastry, cake and fruit. Do not expect eggs because none of the hotels provided any type of eggs. There was also american style coffee, espresso, cappucino, hot chocolate and a variety of juices and the sitting area for breakfast was large enough to sit 40 people. There was also a small bar area that had hot food at the front of the hotel but I didn't explore that at all so besides telling you it's there I can't provide much. The staff was friendly and efficient, not overly so but not mechanical either.The worst part of this hotel was the location as it's about 30 min or more drive time from the sights in Rome and the Vatican.","March 24, 2014","14    Domidea Hotel

653,"We spent a week in this hotel during New Year holidays. I would like to start with the location, which was unbelievably inconvenient. This is not Rome, it suburbs and definately not a very safe one. If you are travelling without a car, you will have to spend about 45 minutes on the metro to get from the centre, then wait for 15-20 minutes for a bus and finally have a bumpy ride for 15 minutes in it. If you don't want to be robbed, I also won't recommend you to return later than 10 o""clock and try to conceal any packages from expensive boutiques. There is absolutely nothing near the hotel except for a gas station, casino and a club Cleopatra, which suspiciosly look like a stripclub.The rooms are not very big, poorly furnished, with very very uncomfortable small beds and tiny TV. Our air conditioneer didn't work properly, so the tempreture was a surprise: we could wake up in the middle of the night because it's suddenly 15 degrees and freezing or on the opposite because it started to raise the temperature up to +29. To be fair I should mention, that the room was however always clean.When you leave the room check your lockers on the luggage twice, because we sometimes had a strong feeling that someone was looking through our stuff.As for breakfast, I think it is a very big word for that dry ration that they give to you (no hot meal, sometimes even no cheese for bread, only lots of kinds of bread and buns).In the conclusion I would like to say that maybe in some cases it worth to visit this hotel but only for its reasonable price, for a short period and ONLY if you have your own car.It is definately not a 4 star hotel, max 3-.","January 9, 2014","14    Domidea Hotel

When the hotel found out that we would be 4 adults and 3 children, they made us pay for another room, even if it was only for one night. We paid 151 euro for one night in a room that was way too big for two adults and two children. The rooms were huge by European standards and very clean. The wifi worked okay. The front desk was very helpful and friendly. However, they really do mean it when they say ""only 4 people"" despite the fact that the couch turns into a futon and you can sleep 7 comfortably. I would not stay here. We've had better hotels for less money.","January 6, 2014","14    Domidea Hotel

655,"This hotel was a total let-down and is no way anywhere close to the claimed four-star level. The rooms are small, my laptop screen is bigger than the tiny television, the shower is flimsy and lacking in hot water, there is no assistance for luggage, parking is minimal, the breakfast does not measure up, and the internet is a joke.I booked two rooms. One was a Double (Single Use), and it was clearly marked as such. There was even one single silhouette so there was no confusion. The other room was a Double Use, there were two silhouettes, and there was no mention of single use. When we arrived, we were told there would be a 25 euro fee for the second person in the second room. I complained, and I was told that it doesn't matter what is said online, this was their policy. I looked again and saw that the same room for two people was only 10 euros more than the room for one person. I had to fight and enlist Agoda's help, but I did finally get the price reduced to 10 euros more per night instead of the 25 euro.This hotel is listed as a business hotel. For a business hotel, the internet was unusable the entire first day. I got online, and it took me an hour to send three short e-mails responses (I had to wait and wait for the messages to actually be sent.) Then it died completely. I went to the staff, and they insisted it was working, suggesting I should come to the lobby. I showed them it wasn't working, then they realized that their own internet was not working. At this point, the receptionist literally threw up his hands and bluntly told me that the manager would be in at 10:00 AM the next morning, and he would have to take care of it. As a ""business"" hotel, we need internet. Not having it is unsatisfactory. Aside from business, I check out restaurants on Tripadvisor to make sure we pick good ones, and I could not. Hence, we just picked four at random, and only one was adequate. As I had no internet, I had to make three toll free calls. The hotel charged 3 euros each for a free call, even if their internet caused the issue.One reason we picked this hotel is that it supposedly had parking. The hotel has 89 rooms, but less than 20 parking spaces. We had to park out on the road away from the hotel as all the spaces were taken by 6:00 PM.The hotel website indicates that they have a free shuttle to the nearest metro station. What they fail to mention is that the shuttle does not seem to be available much, and it is only free if you have an upgraded room. For the standard room, you have to pay.I have never stayed in a four-star hotel nor a business hotel that did not have CNN, CNBC, BBC, or some international news. There was one English-language station that showed standard entertainment series, and that was it. Of course, with the tiny screen, even that one channel was pretty much unwatchable unless you sat at the end of the bed.On a more minor note, the reservation was supposed to be all inclusive as far as price, but there was an additional three euros per head per night tax added to the bill.Service was impersonal and even rude. The cleaning ladies were nice, and the early morning receptionist went out of her way to be helpful, using her iPhone to pull some phone numbers off the internet. I wish I had her name as she was a bright spot in this very disappointing stay.All told, this hotel was extremely substandard for what is was supposed to be. I cannot recommend to anyone that they should stay at the hotel.","October 30, 2013","14    Domidea Hotel

656,"We stayed for two nights and were upgraded to a comfort room so cannot comment on the standard rooms. Our room was enormous, two double wardrobes, plenty of drawers, full length mirror. We had a small balcony which looked out over the bus depot next door, however it you looked further there were views of the countryside around Rome. Our bathroom was lovely, large shower cubicle, brilliant shower with hot water, plenty of towels and there was lots of storage space for toiletries. Breakfast was good, plenty of choice. The coffee was a bit of an issue as there was only one machine so there was a waiting time. There was filter coffee but it was not fresh, this is what british and german people like and maybe they should consider making coffee pots available to save queuing at the machine. That said, it was a good breakfast and I would recommend this hotel for business travel and for visiting Rome if you are fairly self reliant and happy to use public transport. The price was really good, I had paid more to stay in a so called 4 star in Latina the night before and this hotel is way above the standard of that hotel. Just one thing though, the public areas have strange doors that look as though they belong in a sports centre.","October 21, 2013","14    Domidea Hotel

657,"All in all, this was a comfortable quite location with a very good breakfast for most places in Italy. They had a lovely buffet that did not run out of food every a.m.! Staff was pretty helpful for little things we needed and questions in general. We stayed in Rm 128, which was small but adequate for two people. it had good closet and drawer space. The biggest downside of this hotel it that it is at the END of one of the tram lines PLUS you then have to take a 15 min. bus ride to the hotel. We figured we spent at least 90-120 min each day traveling back and forth to get to the highlights of Rome that we really wanted to see. We probably did not save enough money overall to make it worth the extra cost of the transportation either.We had one issue with the room. Every night the AC went off automatically so we had to get up at 12:15am and turn it back on because there were no screens on the windows and bugs that would have come in, so we had to leave it on.Next time we go to Rome we will for sure stay closer to the actual city rather than a hotel with nothing but a restaurant and bar close by.","October 17, 2013","14    Domidea Hotel

Location wise it was about 10/15 mins drive from the nearest metro but the hotel provided a shuttle service which solved that distance problem.

660,"This was my third stay at the Domidea, and unlike other hotels it's quality is consistently high. All the staff I encountered have a good command of English - great for us lazy brits (myself included) who often cannot be bothered to learn a second language.They are always polite and friendly, and nothing is ever too much trouble.In particular the barman, while always professional and courteous is also quite happy to chat in between serving other customers, and will point out new beers he has in stock for you to try.The young lady in the breakfast room is equally excellent at all she does, single-handedly (or so it appears) supplying a vast array of meats, pastries and other typical continental fare with spotlessly clean tables, cutlery and crockery. Equally as friendly and welcoming as the barman (but much more attractive!!!!). Personally I have not encountered the ""really long queues"" for breakfast as commented by one reviewer, although once it was a ""little busy"". Having said that, I am usually having breakfast just after 6:30 when it opens!!!!I have stayed in three different types of rooms, the one for this visit being a quite small room on the ground floor. Not a problem for me on business on my own, but possibly a little cramped for a couple on holiday where you are more likely to spend time in the room than I. For me, however, even the smallest room was perfect. Again, like the rest of the hotel, it was spotlessly clean, great shower (possibly a minus for people who like baths - I am not sure if any rooms have baths.) and a comfortable bed.Love the free wi-fi with no fiddly passwords on small phones, great signal in the room and in the public areas and no ""one device only"" restriction.A minor downside is that other than for breakfast, the hotel has no restaurant of its own. However, there is a resaurant literally less than a minute walk from the hotel, (for a UK reader, you will know what I mean when I say ""like a Premier Inn""). I have never used the restaurant so I cannot comment. The reason being is that the bar serves 5 or 6 different pasta dishes, and I find them quite tasty and the quantity is just right. And two of the three times I have visited this hotel I have been on my own, and I really cannot be bothered to sit in a restaurant waiting heaven knows how long for a meal to come. Whereas the pasta at the bar arrives in an easy 10 minutes - on a bad day!!!!Although I see holiday makers at the hotel, I would class it more of a business hotel - there are no nice views, no pool, no spa, but that is assuming you require such things - although a nice message would be good at the end of a long hard day in the office!!!!!!As a business hotel, I think it is absolutely excellent. Never had to even think about complaining about anything, and being what I believe to be an independant hotel, they clearly try harder than a hotel that is part of a chain. And for me, they succeed - big time.I have to confess that I found this hotel by accident - the hotel I normally stayed at was full and I was looking for another hotel in the same area or very near to it. However, the Domidea is now my first choice whenever I go to Rome. I would definately recommend it, especially to people on business.OOPS!! I mis-clicked the Fitness Centre (they don't have one) and Room Service (Not sure if they have it but if they did I did not make use of it), so PLEASE IGNORE the ""Terrible"" for those two items below.","July 22, 2013","14    Domidea Hotel

For the rest, I suggest considering Hotel Domidea as a good option for their stay in Rome. Staff is excellent. Parking and W-Fi are free, rooms are big, new and clean and the breakfast is very good. Depending on the location of the sights to visit someone can use his owned or rental car or public transport combined or not with hotel's bus. You need only 1,5 euro to get a 100 min. ticket and in normal conditions, about half an hour of driving or 40-45 min. of public transportation to Colosseo. However, traffic to Rome (by car) or to Rebibbia station (by bus) can be heavy.

663,"We stayed there for few days in last August. Hotel is very new and modern. (it is only couple years old). For some people location might be deal breaker, you won't get a room with the view in there. Most of the rooms have windows overlooking inside patio. But that's probably the only minus. Rooms are very modern and quite spacious, with very well furnished/finished bathrooms. Breakfast is served in 2 places: breakfast room and reception bar. In the bar you are getting barist service for duration of the breakfast. Coffes are just amazing, especially Marocchino. Bus stop is just outside hotel. It takes few minutes to get to metro (subway) station. There is also complimentary bus shuttle service. By metro you can get to all main attractions in Rome. It takes about 15 minutes to get to Colloseum. You can buy tickets next to bus stop. Nearly next door there is ""discount"" grocery supermarket. Bottle of water is just 15cent for 1,5 litre.

664,"If you are looking for an affordable, yet modern hotel in Rome I would highly recommend hotel Domidea. Its slightly out of the main city center but very easy to reach by public transport. We traveled from Rome Fumicinio airport by train to the termini station for €14 each, use the fast ticket machines in the station for the cheapest tickets rather than the information and ticket desks who try to combine packages for extra money and they are not worth it. Make sure you purchase your ticket before you get on the train, once on board you cannot purchase a ticket and will be fined €50 per person if you do not have one. Also make sure you stamp your ticket before boarding, there are small green stamping machines on the platform. Once at the termini we purchased a weeks travel card for the metro, around €24 each but valid on all metros, trams and buses around Rome. We bought this from one of the newspaper stalls inside the station.We took the blue metro line as far north as it would go to Rebbibia station, then had the option of the number 473, 474 or 075 bus to take us to the stop by the hotel. The hotel does advertise a free shuttle to Rebbibia station but it is actually €1 per person but we never used it as the public transport was only a two minute walk away and free with our metro passes. In all, from the hotel to the city center it took around 35 minutes travel time which we didn't mind for the price we paid.The hotel rooms were modern and comfortable, there was a TV which picked up sky news in English but we didn't really use it. Free WiFi in the hotel was useful although signal was poor in some areas of the bedroom. We found sitting by the door was the best spot to get good signal. There was a fridge and a good sized bathroom with lovely power shower.Breakfast was good, the breakfast room is quite small but there was always a table for us and good was replenished quickly throughout the morning.We had a great holiday and would book this hotel again if we returned to Rome.","May 4, 2013","14    Domidea Hotel

668,"First of all this hotel had a fantastic price offer for the week end. Must say that you can chose it only if you have the car since is just inside the GRA (the big ring around Rome) and is pretty hard to reach it with public transportation (by the way they have a shuttle too). On the other side I have to tell that the hotel is a very good balance price/quality. Not a super 4 stars hotel, but clean, new, good facilities (i.s. free wi-fi in the room, free parking ...). The breakfast is also good and with many things to chose (especially cakes). Well I strongly reccomend to book this hotel and check before for the offer. Also after the first visit they give you a voucer that you can use as discount (6%) in your second visit.","November 19, 2012","14    Domidea Hotel

669,"I booked this charming place for my fiance as a birthday treat and we couldnt have asked for more.Gianluca is the best host you could ask for and cannot do enough for you day or night. He will give you a great itinerary based on your likes, dislikes and how long you have to stay and also give you tips on quiet places to purchase tickets and times to visit. The rooms are perfect. Clean, comfortable, quiet and you ate spoilt with free coffee, tea, biscuits and a few bottles of water and cans of drink in your room. There is a lovely little terrace on the roof for breakfast and night time star gazing and the location is amazing.TipsWhen you find the block you enter the building and go through the glass door in your right and take the lift to the top, thats where the rooms are.Everything is either walkable or a few stops on the metro away and you are on the vaticans doorstep. There are also loads of local shops, restaurants, a 24 hour bakery and gelato within 2 minutes of the place.There is a metro and bus stop next to the hotel.You can get a 520 bus from the airport to cinecitta for a few euros and then the metro to ottaviano which is the stop by the hotel. This journey total can take 35-45 minutes or if the bus drivers a looney like ours, it takes 25 minutes.Make sure you have cash for the metro as you cannot buy tickets with card.Book all your tickets for the vatican museum, coloseum, forum etc beforehand as the queues are a nightmare with no shade.Gianluca will recommend a gelato place near parliament that is a must. The selection is huge and it tastes amazing.If you are after luxury and waiters and receptions in a large hotel this isnt for yoy. If you want a lovely clean, spacious and quiet place with excellent transport links and great hosts (including an excellent hrrakfast cooked how you like it by gianluca) i highly recommend this place.","July 6, 2019","15    QuodLibet

675,"Short review: Don’t bother looking anymore, just book Quodlibet now!Longer review: Our first time in Rome so, having decided to stay on the Vatican ‘side’ of the river we chose Quodlibet. It took about 2 minutes, from meeting Gianluca and seeing our room, to realise we had made the right choice. The guest house (on the 4th floor with a rather quirky lift) is spotlessly clean with a great roof terrace for breakfast and a kitchen where tea, coffee, biscuits & pastries are always available (in addition to a Nespresso machine and a complimentary mini bar in your room).Gianluca, ever friendly and obliging, then spends 20 or so minutes explaining Rome with use of a map (and a selection of coloured marker pens!). This became our ‘bible’ for our three day visit and not once were Gianluca’s recommendations (sights, restaurants, transport etc.) wide of the mark.We leave it to you what to see in this amazing city, and our only suggestions would be to make sure you pre-book the Vatican (includes Sistine Chapel) and the Colosseum unless you like queuing for hours. Other than that do yourselves a favour and book into Quodlibet and let the excellent Gianluca be your advisor, guide, and helper - you will not regret it.","June 23, 2019","15    QuodLibet

Gives advice how best to roam the city.Modern, luxury, clean rooms, not too spacious, but not cramped either. Beds are a bit small (1.80m long). Windows properly insulated. Airco silent and effective.Roof terrace, embraced by tree tops and granting a slight view of the St. Peter Basilica, has a lounge set and is therefor a nice escape when one would prefer a moment of solitude away from the busy city. 5 min. walk to Metro station. 15 min. to Vatican. 30 min. to city centre where the major highlights are.Infinite restaurants, trattoria and gelato surrounding the premises.","June 21, 2019","15    QuodLibet

The rooms were spotless and had good air conditioning. Breakfast was insane. Delicious pastries, blood orange juice, coffee, meats and cheeses, eggs, etc. The location was very close to the Vatican and a metro station, so we were able to get just about everywhere with ease.

We arrived late at night long after the check in time and were warmly greeted at the entrance of the building by Gianluca who was waiting to assist us with our luggage. He was very knowledgeable and provided us with important information on all the major attractions in Rome, the best restaurants for the European experience and the different and best means of transportation. This information was invaluable, and as a result we were able to explore quite a bit of Rome on our own. He made our trip one that we will not forget soon.QuodLibet is centrally located and particularly close to the Vatican. Our room was large, comfortable, and very nicely decorated. The European style breakfast served each morning on the roof terrace by our wonderful host was excellent.

We stayed in the Spring room which was very clean, quiet, comfortable and cozy. Rooms in Rome tend to be on the smaller side, but our room suited our needs very well. Actually, there was also satellite TV so I could watch the matches when we came back after dinner. The check-in process was straightforward.The rooms are on the 4th floor accessible by a couple of steps and an elevator from the building’s lobby. Gianluca, the owner was most helpful getting us settled into our room, explaining how to use the electronic thermostat etc. The weather during our stay was a little cool, so we were using the heat. The ventilation system looked modern so I think the air-conditioning should be good as well. Quodlibet is well-located for walkers and the Metro. This year, for personal reasons, I needed to use taxis to get around and Gianluca showed me how to use the taxi app on my phone. He was also very thoughtful in bringing lactose-free milk, cheeses and yoghurt when he saw that I carried my own lactose-free milk. Breakfast on the rooftop patio had plenty of choices and provided ample fuel for a full day of activities.  The shower had plenty of hot water and the bed was very comfortable.Upon our checkout, Gianluca had a small parting gift for us to remember our stay.We have been in Rome many times previously and it was very pleasant to stay at Quodlibet where we felt at home.","May 24, 2019","15    QuodLibet

My wife and I exited the metro less than two blocks from the B&B and arrived late afternoon April 4th and checked in with Gianluca. He showed us to our room and explained the facilities. The room was as shown on the website, clean and enough room for my wife and I. We then went to his office and sat down to plan our stay. He laid out a map of Rome and pulled out colored markers and proceeded to tell us how Rome is a very walkable city. With one colored marker he laid out a path starting from the B&B ending near the Spanish Steps, hitting all the popular sights along the way with places to eat and times to walk between the sights, that was one day's exploring. He then did two more different colored routes that were spot on for the next two days of our stay. We walked so much and didn't even realize it until we returned to our room and then the tiredness hit us. We were recharged the following morning by the breakfast that was plentiful and back on our way. Gianluca's recommendations for restaurants were exceptional, prices were reasonable and the food delicious. All in all, a very pleasant stay at QuodLibet and the care package Gianluca sent us on our way home with was a very nice touch as he bid us farewell early in the morning.

Final words to say a big thank you to our hosts who were welcoming, friendly and gave us very useful information about where to eat and other suggestions to make our visit a success.The leaving gift was a lovely gesture.

706,"Visiting Rome in the off-season, we stayed three wonderful nights with Gianluca at Quodlibet, a few hundred yards from St Peter's. His excellent recommendations and fascinating conversation over the excellent breakfast in the roof-garden every morning were as much highlights of our stay as anything else in Rome. The rooms are impeccably comfortable, with hot powerful showers, espresso machines, a full shared kitchen, and a peaceful atmosphere. You get conversation when you want it, and quiet when you need it. I cannot recommend it more highly. I will be rushing back at the next possible opportunity.","January 21, 2019","15    QuodLibet

707,"No surprise QuodLibet has so many outstanding reviews. This place is amazing and the whole team at QuodLibet makes your stay an incredible experience. From our arrival, Gianluca provided maps and walking itineraries, as well as restaurant and gelato places to stop along the way. The location is perfect. Just a quick walk to the Vatican, or to keep going across the river to anywhere within Rome. Also just steps away from the metro, although we never used it. Breakfast each morning was delicious and the girls were helpful in providing anything you'd need. Everything about our stay was fantastic. Next time we're in Rome, we'd definitely look to stay here again.","January 20, 2019","15    QuodLibet

708,"We had a wonderful time while in Rome, and Gianluca made our trip less stressful. His attentiveness was refreshing as he mapped out walking routes and offered local suggestions for restaurants, shops, gelato, and local specialties. The apartment was immaculate and very comfortable. Every evening we returned it was refreshing to walk into a clean fresh smelling room that you could tell they took pride in cleaning. Every morning Gianluca welcomed us onto the roof terrace for breakfast and asked us about our time and answered any questions we had. It was a 2 minute walk to a train station and about 10 minute walk from the Vatican. I will recommend QuadLibet to everyone I know going to Rome and would stay here again.

718,"We stayed at Quod Libet in October for 3 nights. We arrived late and were met by Gianluca at the door. We were showed to our superbly clean large room (comfortably sleeping 4 of us) and talked through all we needed. The children were tired but hungry so we went next door to the most wonderful 24 hour bakery! Who knew such a thing existed. We also asked him where we could get a bottle of wine at this time of night and Gianlca emerged with a bottle of beautiful Italian red and 2 glasses which we took upstairs and drank on the lovely roof terrace feeling very continental. They provided complimentary water and soft drinks in the rooms and there was a communal kitchen were you could have tea and coffee should you desire it. We had a very peaceful night's sleep. The next morning we had breakfast on the roof terrace which was plentiful with nice coffee, pastries from next door, fruit, yoghurt and gorgeous coffee and hot chocolate and then Gianluca drew us various routes - walking and then metro transport home to take in the main sights. He spoke impeccable English. The tours were amazing and encompassed the best tiramisu, the best ice cream parlour and coffee shop as well as all the breath-taking sights.. The Vatican is only 5-10 minutes away and was magical to be able to go at night to see it all lit up and pop in when the queues had died down. The metro only a few minutes.We had a very comfortable stay and when we left we were given a parting gift to remember our stay. Such kind people and what wonderful hospitality.

Price no dearer than many of Rome's lower-end hotels with advantage of good breakfast on the enclosed roof terrace and complimentary real coffee and biscuits at any time of day. If that's not reason enough to want to stay then the real clincher are the hosts. They are infinitely patient, friendly and knowledgable. Give Gianluca a list of your interests and what you want to see and he will come up with an itinerary based on how much time you have, how much walking you are prepared to do and what other sights he thinks you shouldn't miss.

There was a fridge in the room with some bottles and cans you could buy.Breakfast was basic. There only ever seemed to be enough for one croissant each left out, although there was plentiful slices of toasting white pan.The accommodation is close to transport links and within walking distance of the Vatican.Staff were helpful but we felt they could have done more - for example when I asked them to order us a taxi we were instead pointed to the nearest taxi bay and told to walk there and wait.On our last day they very kindly let us leave our bags so we could spend one last morning in Rome.

We weren't expecting much as the prices were generally fairly low but I can't be happier with our service, the rooms, the location and especially the helpful and kind staff. We were picked up from the airport by a very polite man whom the hotel had arranged, and were taken to the hotel around a 20 minute drive away. When we arrived the gentlemen on the desk, were just that - gentlemen! And took care of every one of our needs; which including staying late after their shift had finished because our flight was later. Still, he Talked us through everything we needed to know about the bus stops, the metro how to get to the main attractions and handed us a map to help us too. He then took us to our room, (which was absolutely pristine and very trendy) and told us if we needed any more to just ask! The next morning we went for breakfast, which was all you need, toast, cereals, eggs, meats cheeses and coffees. Very good to start off our busy days! Even the staff in here were kind and welcoming always asking us if we wanting anything else. When we went downstairs the man on the desk explained more of the hotels surroundings and even made sure we had a mobile phone on us and gave us their number and if we got lost and they could help us back! Generally, the hotel is in a fantastic location, just ten min walk to the Vatican or a very short bus ride and only a 20 min bus ride to the colleseum. The gentlemen on the desk will show you exactly where everything is anyway if you are a bit clueless like we were,to help get you started.

We will definitely return and recommend to anyone wishing to stay in Rome. Although 20mins walk from the Vatican it has great local transport links and offers a friendlier more real experience of Rome, far better than the stuck up reception we received in the posh areas of the city. 5 stars.","February 7, 2016","16    Star of Rome

Room spotless bed comfy bathroom and toiletries provided. Mini bar in room. Location was easy bus ride from Vatican and central rome or metro 10 min walk away uphill!!!! Restaurant underneath rooms but not connected. Hotel is actually 3 b&bs in 2 floors of an office block which is a bizarre experience but it didn't spoil or take anything away from our stay in fact it was a great value hotel for the price very near the Vatican. If arriving to ciampino use hotel arranged shuttle as once paid for transfer coach to termini then taxi oin it works out the same.

750,"ok, i'm going to keep this short and sweet.Arrived and thought, oh god, this can't be right - we pulled up outside a random, almost disused building which wasn't very aesthetically pleasing. Walked in and was greeted by a extremely nice, well mannered enthusiastic host who filled us with relief.So, basically the owners seems to be buying floors or whatever of this old style hotel and then completely transforming them into very modern, clean, stylish rooms. They have 3 floors all finished to a very high standard. The owners are great, very helpful, speak brilliant english, are available and at reception from 7 till 7, just brill. Make it so you can get straight into your holiday.We stayed in room 15 i think, Caesar. Twin sink bathroom, walk in shower, real modern decor, sofa bed, wardrobe, king size bed in the adjoining room, balcony, TV, fridge - you name it. The hall of each floor is well lit, clean, warm with a communal computer for web access - and of course there is free wifi.Breakfast is your standard continental - the staff always offer you fresh coffee and keep refilling. Nothing is too much trouble.Ok, Rome itself. The place has been ruined by migrants. every tourist attraction has groups of them - if not trying to sell you a selfie stick, trying to sell you tickets to beat the queues for something you don't have to cue for. They get up in your face and start shouting at you in the street. Do not buy anything from the street traders - find the souvenir shops and mini markets, around 1/10th of the price for some things.The traffic is mental - if you don't have your wits about you, you will be killed. red lights and crossings mean nothing, everyone uses their phone even on motorbike, the road markings are ignored, its an absolute free for all.The buses are the best way to get about but the signage is awful. it will take you a while to figure out and you will get lost - they are cheap however and regular. Food everywhere is just pizza pasta and tomato sauce - but I have to say our italian restaurants are much nice. Find the right place though and you can pay 3.50 for 1/2 litre of red wine! Beer is expensive and McDonalds is a god send, low prices and reliable food. Architecture is stunning, history is breathe taking. When we went however, the spanish steps were closed and the privy fountain or whatever was switched off with scaffold around.It rained all day saturday and the streets can't handle it, you end you walking in a puddle everywhere you go.Top top tip - don;t go for the weekend only, we went Thursday to Sunday. Luckily did the vatican city and st peters church thing on the very first day - didn't queue for anything and walked around very easily. saturday we walked past the same places - 3 hr queues and absolutely crowed with people - could definitely spoil the weekend.Rome is a must but is certainly not the place we imagined it to be - can't make a romantic weekend of it but will certainly be taken back by the history of the place.The Star of Rome certainly gave us somewhere to go which felt very comfortable and allowed you to relax and catch your breathe. Very clean and modern - a true hidden gem.Oh, room has air con and make sure the ladies are covered up when visiting places with picture of Jesus in. shoulders cannot be on show, boobs mustn't be either, lads can't wear shorts etc.","October 20, 2015","16    Star of Rome

The rooms are meticulously clean and have private baths, each room has coffee, tea, a refrigerator, cable tv and free wifi. Our rooms had balconies, so it was nice to sit outside in the evenings.I'd originally booked for 2 nights, but due to the room not being available for the 3rd night we moved to another room for the last 2 nights. The original reservation was for a triple, it was a beautiful and clean room, large shower and comfortable bed. The room we moved into had a queen bed, the room was nice as well. The shower was a bit smaller and the mattress was uncomfortable; you could actually feel and hear the springs. The last night we slept on top of the comforter in hopes of a more comfortable sleep. The breakfast was fantastic, pastries, fresh fruit, as well as yogurt, cereal, breads, boiled eggs, ham and cheese; and of course my daughter enjoyed the Nutella. They make you cappuccino and espresso's to order. They will make adjustments if you have special dietary needs.I found the staff exceptional. They are available 8 AM - 8 PM, and even responded by email at 10 PM. They helped us with our luggage, recommended some terrific places to eat, and gave us great directions on how to navigate on the bus. By bus they are located minutes from the Vatican, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, as well as easy access to little markets, pharmacies and restaurants. Right across the street is a fantastic gelato shop.I highly recommend The Star of Rome for anyone that is looking for a nice place at a reasonable rate.

I spent hours researching some were to stay that was close to the centre of Rome, a good neighbourhood and easily accessible transportation. Star of Rome certainly ticked all those boxes. Once I saw the reviews online I contacted the hotel directly speaking with a very friendly and welcoming individual by the name of Damiano, he explained transport links were close by which was exactly as stated no more than 7-10 minutes to the Vatican by bus/20 mins from Termini station. The rooms were modern which was exactly as stated the rooms were clean, modernised and well priced. Damiano even went through the trouble of organising a taxi at the airport. His colleagues/management despite closing at 8pm waited for me outside the hotel when I arrived at 21:40 pm. There are so many positives about this hotel that I would love to say but I think the reviews say it all. Exactly as described my first time in Rome and I will def return here......Also your looking for somewhere close and nearby theres a restaurant at the very top of the hill about 10 mins walk, 2 stops on the bus called Grileria La Pizzeria food is great, good prices (£15-25 a head /20-35 euros) they do steaks, pizza pasta, cocktails, wines, deserts.Enjoy!.","May 4, 2015","16    Star of Rome

776,"My friends and I travelled to Rome for a four-day city break and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Prior to our arrival, Cristiano arranged for an airport pick up to and from the B&B. As it was our first time in Rome, we thought it was great that they offered this service. The driver Massimo was cool and we ended up using his vehicle more than once during our stay!We were a group of 8 and had rooms located on the same floor which was a bonus. The B&B has quite a homely feel to it, and yet had the same standards as a 5* hotel. The rooms were spectacular, simply and yet creatively decorated, each with a different artistic theme. They were always cleaned to perfection and fresh towels were provided each day. Breakfast was also good. Simple but tasty food including a selection of bread, cheeses, meats, pastries and fruit. Every morning we were offered fresh coffee which I thought was a nice touch.As it was only a weekend away we didn't spend much time at the B&B, whenever we did the staff were friendly and very helpful. My cousin and I are usually great at planning, however on this occasion we didn't have an itinerary for our trip. On the Saturday morning, one of the guys gave us a map and literally a plan for the whole day which was lovely of him. I’m from London, so I found Rome to be quite a small city. This is a positive though, as the B&B is quite close to the centre – perhaps 10/15 minutes via public transport. You can hop on a number of buses outside on the main road. There are multiple shops conveniently located close by, including a Mc Donald's for you fast food lovers! As a group of 18-25 year-old's we did a good amount of site seeing! Rome is a remarkable city, with tons of museums, restaurants, bars and historical sites & the Star of Rome was a great base to explore the city. All in all we had a wonderful stay at the Star of Rome. This small, yet boutique B&B will definitely be my first choice when returning to this city.","December 23, 2014","16    Star of Rome

777,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights at the beginning of my trip to Italy. It was overall a nice but not outstanding stay.First, the junior suite was large, but there were no drawers for unpacking. The bed linens were scratchy. The shower was tiny. The toilet didn't flush very well and required several flushes after each use. Also, while the pictures made it look like the room was colorful and bright, it was actually all grey and black and white. There were a number of stairs to climb with a heavy suitcase.Also, there is not a staff member on duty for most of the time. There's a little office, but usually no one is in it.The breakfast was basic and didn't taste fresh.The location is fantastic, and the little balcony was lovely.Overall, for room size and location and view, choose this place. For amenities, I'd choose another hotel.","April 25, 2019","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

778,"We stayed here as a recommendation from friends who have also stayed here! More services apartment than hotel but this adds to its charm! Some of the rooms have a balcony that looks over the Piazza Novena - so you can sit there and just gaze at the beautiful buildings... listen to some street music and just people watch. Room was modern, clean and functional. Staff were wonderfully friendly and spoke excellent English. They are not on site 24/7 but are contactable via phone if needed. Very central Rome, all main tourist sites are 5-30 minutes walk away no need for transport. About 30-45 minutes from airport. Luggage storage available if needed and an excellent breakfast of coffee, pastries, yogurt, cereal - definitely will keep you going until lunch. Restaurants are a stone throw away from your room. Aim for the ones in the street where you enter the suites rather than the more touristy (and more expensive) Piazza Novena The suite also has a mini bar, soft drinks are free. Despite being on a main piazza full of life, the windows are double glazed so you don’t hear anything when shut. Cannot recommend this enough!! Service and suite were excellent.

They have double pane windows that keep the noise and cold out. It was a clean, modern, spacious, warm room. A very charming place! I felt like a local staying here. It's an old palace. I had the pleasure of being welcomed by Tomas who was wonderful. He took the time to help me plan my evening and gave great recommendations. The location is amazing - shops, restaurants, cafes and you're staying on the piazza!! I highly recommend this place.","March 8, 2019","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

Breakfast served every morning drinking my espresso from the balcony watching all the people was worth every penny.Every staff member I care in contact with was very polite and helpfully. On the last day 6 in morning I left my passport and money in the room along with room key as the cab was waiting outside I called and they immediately showed up to open the door as staff isnt always on premises.

782,"What a hidden little gem, the location is unbeatable and the view from the window was breathtaking. We had the superior room with the window overlooking the Piazza and it was amazing, every day we sat at our window watching the people and the buskers. All major attractions are so close and within walking distance. The back streets were great and provided plenty of choice for lunch or dinner. Breakfast was delivered to our room each morning at the time you choose, starting from 7:30am and the selection is more than ample, although croissants were a little uneatable due to their burnt crisp state. It was an added bonus to have a fridge in the room with juices and soft drinks free of charge. The room was modern, generously spacious, spotlessly clean and the beds were super comfy. Once the shutters were closed we heard no noise from the outside or the room next door. We only ever saw the staff at check in, check out and when our breakfast was delivered, so just be aware no one is physically there to assist during the day/night. We would definitely stay here again - an unforgettable stay. TIP: get the private transfer from the airport, they will deliver you direct to the front door which would be hard to find without them pointing it out. Make sure you confirm your arrival time with staff. We waited at the entrance door buzzing for a good 15 mins till someone came along and were told the buzzer goes to another apartment.","October 31, 2018","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

The room was very quiet, the bed was comfortable, and the location provided a great central location to explore Rome. The conditions of the room however needed some attention; the bath and shower needed some maintenance and repair (signs of minor damage on floors, shower, and walls); the balcony was not swept of previous guests' cigarettes; egg shells were found in the hot water kettle, and the cable stations only showed a few local Rome stations and Arabic-language channels.

We unpacked and went out to take in the sights and have some dinner. When we arrived back, we were delighted to find a brand new single bed had been made up in our room. You would think that the room would now be cramped, but it most certainly was not! With a spacious shower, fresh towels every day, tea/coffee and a selection of soft drinks, continental breakfast served in the room (which we ate on the balcony) crisp cotton sheets on comfortable beds, free WiFi......need I go on!Definitely a 5 star location, but the 6th star is awarded for the extra effort made to make everything as perfect as possible for our holiday!","October 6, 2018","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

The breakfast is delivered to your room at a time that suits you, and was absolutely gorgeous. There’s not one negative thing I could say about this place.

788,"Just returned this morning from Palazzo de Cupis and i have to say it was fantastic. All the positive reviews are well deserved. The location overlooking the Piazza Navona is beautiful, a wonderfully vibrant piazza to watch over with a glass a wine but because of the soundproof windows, easily blocked out if required. Because there is only 3 rooms we didnt see another guest until the morning of our departure which suited us fine. The concierge service was great, who arranged our transport to and from the airport which i would recommend as the entrance is in my opinion difficult to find. The restaurants just outside the entrance were amazing, our personal favourite being Ponte e Parione. All the landmarks are within walking distance. I really cant speak highly enough of the place, a real gem and would now be the only place i would stay on my next visit","August 6, 2018","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

789,"Stayed at the the Palazzo de Cupis Monday to Thursday and I would definitely recommend this hotel! There are only 3 rooms, two of them have a balcony, we had booked the room with no balcony which was fine as the window opened and looked out onto Piazza Navona square which is always buzzing. The guy who met us and checked us in was super friendly and really helpful. I’ve not given full marks just purely because of internal noise and water pressure. Positives:-Amazing location, so central, safe and convenient -Booked our car to and from the airport using their concierge service that they offer, again this was faultless and only a few euros more than faffing around trying it get a taxi (this also meant the driver knew where to drop us off as the hotel is discreetly hidden!)-The windows completely shut out the noise from the Square outside-King size bed-Mini bar with free soft drinks-Continental breakfast is brought to you at a time you choose-Very friendly and family run, didn’t see another guest!-Good air conNot quite so positive:-The walls are thin so while there is no noise from outside, you can hear people coughing and running water in their bedroom or in the corridor-The shower pressure wasn’t great, washing hair would have taken a while!Tips:-We didn’t eat in the Square but had a very expensive drink at one of the bars...go round the corner and get a €5 Aperol Spritz and a meat and cheese board from the amazing I Pizzicaroli ! So cheap but top quality deli meat and cheese and very friendly-Uber is almost non existent and expensive, although we did find one at 3am after going to Stadio Olimpico for a gig -Download MyTaxi app, it’s great for whizzing around, we didn’t use public transportI would definitely return to the hotel if in Rome again.","July 3, 2018","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

790,"Unique little, 3-suite, gem overlooking the Piazza Navona. Great fun sitting on your private, small balcony watching all the activities and the tourists. And at night when you close the balcony door, its super quiet and sleeping is no problem. And at 5am the Piazza is completely empty with no people, just fountain and street lamps. Very cool.The suites are quite modern and comfortable with everything you need. And breakfast is served in your room at at time you designate. A word of caution, though, there is no one present after noon, so checking in requires calling Fabrizio to meet you there. And there are several flights of ""palace style"" steps to get to the rooms. This building is an old famous palace, so hence the steps. The entrance is a bit hard to find, and the access street is crowded with patio dining for several sidewalk restaurants that served what looked like horrible ""Italian"" food. I would never eat at any of these places. An interesting place to stay with a perfect location close to most major attractions. Try the Junior Suite, since it is fairly big and comfortable. Cant't beat the view.","June 7, 2018","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

The internet didn’t exist and I looked several times. I didn’t contact the office to complain or have it fixed. Luckily, I have international data on my phone and was fine with that for only 1 night. The plumbing makes a horrible sound with any running water in the bathroom. I’m guessing and electric pump is behind the wall. It was fine since I was alone. Sharing a room would definitely wake up the other person. I had an early departure so I didn’t get breakfast but it was offered after 0730.

The water pump made a horrendous sound, neither coffee pot work and no hot water after one shower. I had to take a cold shower and was not happy. The owner notified Booking.com that we did not check in which was not true. By doing that I could not review them on Booking.com. How clever but I can do it here.

793,"First time in Rome and we stayed a week in room 103 at Palazzo. When coming back I will definitely stay here again. I do agree with the other reviews telling you to avoid eating & drinking at the Piazza Navone (very expensive and not very good) but to sit on the balcony and watch all the buzz was very nice! and yes, when you close your doors its silent in the room! The room itself was of a good size, big closet, nicely decorated and very clean :-) Breakfast is served at your convenience (usually between 8-10) and contains yoghurt, cornflakes, croissants, pain de chocolat, juice and coffee/tea - i.e. not a big hotel buffé, but for us it was perfect - as we then anyway had big italian both lunches and dinner! and gelato in between.. The couple running the place were ever so sweet, helpful and flexible. We could check in right upon arrival (3 hours ahead) and when I had forgotten the key in the room one night they answered right away and where there in 10 min!! (thanks again!!) In my opinion I strongly believe we just couldn't have found a better place in Rome to stay!

The mini bar offers you free water and fizzy drinks, the breakfast was a light snack to get you started for the day ahead. Our bed was ridiculously comfy, shower was relaxing and the hairdryer worked a treat! The accommodation is in a great location if your using public transport or walking to get around, it's not ideal if you hire a car due to nowhere to park.

795,"My family and I have just recently concluded our third stay with this property, and with each and every stay, we are happier and happier. My wife and I as we have done in the past, rented the Junior suite, which is large, clean, beautiful, and provides a balcony, with a stunning view of Piazza Navona. The changes for our stay this year was that my extended family rented out the remaining two rooms, as well as we brought along our six month old son. Ramin and Silvia were extremely accommodating, and went the extra mile, as always to assist us with anything we needed, and could not have made our stay, and made us feel welcome with the baby on this trip. Breakfast is served at the time of your choosing, and offers enough to get you started for your day, assorted pastries, cereals, and coffee. The rooms and facility are extremely clean, and well maintained. Free drinks within the mini bar, soda, waters, and some assorted wines and process for you. Two of the three rooms provide stunning views of the piazza with their balconies, that are large enough for a few people to hang out on. As well as the third room which provides a great view of the piazza through its large windows. All of the rooms are provided with noise proof windows for those loud nights in the piazza while you are trying to unwind, no worries there. The hotel is set in an ideal location, as all of the major tourist attractions are located within a 20 minute walk for you. While you are set within Piazza Navona, and its great views, and its abundance of high priced, mediocre food, you can escape that just by simply stepping out back of the property and wandering through the beautiful cobblestone streets. Once outback of the hotel, do yourself a favor and take advantage of the location and the overwhelming amount of delicious restaurants away from the tourist traps. You can step outside of the property and wander the streets for hours feeling like a local. There is also a nearby grocery store, multiple pharmacies, as well as wine stores within a minutes walk if necessary. My wife and I have traveled to Rome on several occasions, and there is no other property that we would stay at. A few years back we hit the jackpot when I discovered this place, and as previously stated, Ramin and Silvia are incredible hosts that will go out of their way to provide you with the best service and memories for your trip. The hotel hits all of the boxes to make your trip perfect, from the location, to the service, the nearby food and wine, to the stunning views, and to the ease of the walking to all of your favorite sites while in Rome.","December 10, 2017","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

Ramin met us and let us in on arrival after our trans-Atlantic crossing. Our rooms were excellent. We booked the two rooms with balconies for 4 nights (family of 4). The beds were comfortable, the AC worked well (though in late May we didn't need it that much), but the view from the balcony. Oh my. Sunrise. Sunset. Mid-day. Evening entertainment.

The room is air conditioned which works well however you need to ensure the doors are shut and the outer blinds are closed. When we were there the temp was 34 plus and getting hotter. Tips - get a taxi if you travel by rail from Termini station 16 euro, private hire 35 euro. There is a taxi rank near to the apartment. We got a taxi at 0900 on a Sunday.

It was constantly set at 16 degrees but the room never felt cold, something we needed in the 34 degree heat outside. Great breakfast, usual continental, pain au chocolate, croissant, yoghurt, coffee and juice. This is brought to your room at an agreed time.

806,"We are almost finished here with our very first (and certainly not last) trip to Rome. On the strength of reviews here we felt good about booking this hotel - we were not disappointed. Simply put the majority of reviews here are correct - this is an outstanding property that absolutely lives up to its billing. Our trip got off to a great start - using their concierge service via WhatsApp they arranged transfer from the airport directly to the property (which can be hard to find or describe to someone who is not familiar with it). We were greeted at the door by Fabrizio who showed us our room and made us feel very comfortable immediately. The room was exactly as described. Immaculately clean with an updated and very clean and spacious (by European standards) bathroom. The view is, by itself, worth every penny to stay here. Our room's balcony overlooking the Piazza Navona is what vacation dreams are made of...in fact, I am typing this review as I sit on our balcony overlooking the square. The staff was very attentive to our needs and breakfast was served right on time each morning. We have been able to easily walk to all the major Rome attractions (Colosseum/Forum/Palatine, Borghese, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and the Vatican. I can't recommend this property highly enough. In fact, when we are next in Rome this will be the only place we will stay!","January 19, 2017","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

807,"My wife and I just concluded our second stay within the Palazzo De Cupis, and just like our first stay, we could not have been happier. There are three great rooms within this property, and we have stayed in two of the rooms. Our first stay was within the Superior suite, which does not provide a balcony, however two large windows that open up directly to beautiful Piazza Navona. The windows are also set up for you to sit on a stoop and unwind after a long day with a glass of wine.This last stay, we were fortunate enough to stay within the Junior suite, which is a phenomenal room, while my father in law stayed within the Deluxe suite. The Junior suite, along with the Deluxe suite, is a very large, clean, and spacious room, that provides a large balcony on the second floor. For any travelers that have been to Rome, balconies are not easy to come by when booking a stay, and having this second floor balcony, with its view, is amazing, and only adds to a great vacation. For the traveler who loves to just sit back and ""people watch"", grab a bottle of wine, and unwind on the balcony, as you will not find a better place to accomplish your ""people watching"". The breakfast provided is served at a time of your choosing each morning, and is more than enough to get you started for your day of exploration. The two gentlemen who run the property, Ramin and Fabrizio, are extremely accommodating, and more than willing to answer any questions you may have, or to assist with transfer services, tours, or any further accommodations. The location of the property is perfect, for those of you who wish to explore Rome by foot, all of the major attractions are reachable within a short walk:Pantheon - 5 minutesVatican city - 10 minutesSpanish steps - 15 minutesPiazza Venezia - 15 minutesColosseum - 20/25 minutesThere is also a taxi stand about a hundred yards from the back door of the property.Outside of the property, within the Piazza Navona, are an abundance of restaurants. However, unless you are just looking for a glass of wine, I would steer clear. While they provide a stunning view of the Piazza, just like your balcony, they are tourist traps, the food will not be as good, and the prices will be higher. If you are looking for a real Roman experience, and restaurants, there is an enormous amount of options just outside the back door of the property. You will find cobblestone streets, off the beaten path, that you can wander for hours, and find great restaurants and wine. This will also help you get away from the large tourist areas, and help you feel like you are getting a real Italian experience.My wife and I have travelled to Italy several times now, and since discovering this property, there is no other place we will ever stay again while in Rome. We love the property so much, that we have already reserved our room for our next vacation. As well as my family has rented out the remaining rooms, as they have also fell in love with this property. One recommendation I would make is to arrange a private car service through the Palazzo de Cupis. The car service will bring you directly to the rear door and entrance to the property, as it can be difficult to find without.Thank you again for a great stay, and already looking forward to our next trip to Rome.","January 11, 2017","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

Lots of good restaurants nearby (ask the hosts for recommendations-we really liked il Corallo, maybe a 5 minute walk). Was a bit worried about noise from the piazza, especially being only one floor up in a 16th century building, but balcony door was absolutely soundproof! Be sure to stroll down Via dei Coronari off the north end of Piazza Navona for nice shops, restaurants & gelateria.

810,"We stayed here for only one night as we had traveled to the Amalfi Coast prior and on the return, we of course needed one more night in beautiful Roma before flying back to the states. We found this amazing gem of a hotel online and it did not disappoint. Having said that, we contacted the hotel staff prior to departing to the Amalfi Coast (we had been in a different location in Rome for 3 nights.) and asked if they wouldn't mind storing an extra,rather large suitcase for us. We did not want to lug it on the train with us if we did not have to. He more than obliged,kept it safe and had it placed in our room upon arrival. Now that is quality,attentive service! The decor is nice,modern and is spotlessly clean. Our view was beyond amazing.Our only regret was not being able to spend enough time in our room ( last minute shopping and eating filled our day!) It is not very often you can see Piazza Navona in the way that we were able to with the gorgeous view that we had.We had to sadly depart the hotel at 6:am so we were not able to have the breakfast that was offered.Defiantly a place to book again in the future.","October 26, 2016","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

816,"Although it really is all about the location – and the location is second to none – this place is really nice. Since it is a 3 room inn, it has some quirks. But it is a real value and a treat to be able to stay in the middle of one of Rome’s best attractions.I like to review with pros and cons, so here goes.Pros:1. Location. Overlooking fountain of Neptune! All the pics that have been posted of the rooms are accurate. Have included ones of the balcony, which I’m not sure was covered as well. Couldn't resist adding some of the view too.2. Quiet. They installed some really good windows. Couldn’t hear a thing from the piazza with it closed.3. Spacious. Okay, we booked the suite, but all 3 rooms are good sized.4. Nicely appointed. Very tasteful and comfortable, though some furniture is a bit basic.5. Hosts. The guys that we met were friendly and helpful.Cons:1. Ran out of hot water for 2nd shower on day 1. There were odd pumping and whistling sounds behind our room. Old building with renovated plumbing. Like I said, there are some quirks.2. Breakfast. It is okay, delivered, and should be adequate for most. OJ is very fresh. Would be helpful if croissants were not burnt and hard. If breakfast is your thing, just skip it and go out for breakfast. Don’t miss this place because of it. Teapot in room is great, and some might like the Nespresso machine.3. Front door knob. Do something different for access here guys. This thing is a bit past quirky and can be downright hard to operate. The outside and room doors are fine. Use something similar on the front door.Other:1. Shower is not as large as you might think from the pics. Also, it could really benefit from a shower caddy of some sort to hold shampoo, soap, etc.2. Balcony is really tight. Works best if you move the small folding chairs and table in front of the door (for the suite), but then you can’t close the window blinds. Still better than nothing. And I’m guessing there are strict limitations on making any changes.3. This is a second floor walk-up / walk-down. Be prepared for some stairs, but it is not on the 5th floor so should be fine for most.4. This is not a hotel and is not staffed at all times. Should not be a problem, just know what to expect.Did I mention the location is fabulous? Stay here and enjoy! Just expect some quirks and don’t expect a 4/5 star hotel and you will love it!","July 1, 2016","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

817,My wife and I stayed for one night in a suite overlooking Piazza Novonna. The location was great. We were the same distance by foot from the Colosseum and the Vatican---about 30 minutes. We also were able to see the Trevi Fountain and several other piazzas by foot. We had trouble with the entry door in the afternoon but the manager was able to help us. The room had a sleek modern decor with a small balcony overlooking Piazza Novonna. The bed was comfortable and the AC worked great. The bathroom was large with amenities. Breakfast was delivered promptly at 7:30 a.m. as requested. The hotel was able to arrange car transportation for a fee from the airport on our arrival day and was able to arrange a car transfer to the port at Civitavecchia. This would definitely be the place to return to if we had more time to spend in Rome.,"June 27, 2016","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

It was also incredibly quiet even being right on a busy piazza! It was super tiny, but functional. They really needed to put some tissue and extra toilet pater in this room. The breakfast was sort of sad, but nice to have it included and delivered to the balcony. I am in LOVE with Rome and would like to live there if I could figure out how.

825,"First, the location and standard of accommodation are excellent. The balcony looks out onto Piazza Navona with its spectacular Bernini fountain and bustling restaurants and bistros. The room is comfortably large enough and the bathroom well fitted out. The bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on. The staff are very pleasant and friendly, but for me the place falls down a little on the level of service. After we'd checked in and the staff had left we found leftover toiletries in the shower itself and half used drinks in the fridge from the previous occupants, so for me the standard of housekeeping is poor. One of the bedside lights was not working, and when we mentioned it in the morning on delivery of the breakfast we were told it would be replaced during the day. It wasn't, apparently because the bulbs are unusual and they don't keep any spares in stock. As for the breakfast, the croissants/pain au chocolat were bordering on disgusting and helped not at all by the fact that over 2 days all of them were burnt to some degree. The 'toast' on the other hand was only toasted on one side. The sugar and soft drinks from the in room supplies were not replaced, so we couldn't even make tea. Having said all this the for me the place was still saved by the location and standard. I would come back but would hope to see more effort over the small stuff","April 17, 2016","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

It included cappuccino, yogurt, Melba toast (rusks), corn flake cereal, croissants, and juice. It was almost too much - we never finished it all.The room was immaculate, with gleaming hardwood floors and a spotless bathroom. The location is central and within walking distance to everything.

We stayed for 5 nights in the junior suite and loved the location and having a small balcony overlooking Rome's most vibrant piazza - it's a people watcher's dream! It is also reasonably priced compared to other central rooms with a balcony.Piazza Navona is smack in the middle of central Rome so everything is walkable. The room is immaculate and the bed is huge and comfy. Breakfast was very good by Italian standards - you can tick from a list which includes pastries, fruit, yoghurt, toast, ham, cheese, conserves and cornflakes. Even though there's a Nespresso in the room, they make cappuccinos for you as well, which is a nice touch. (However, we found the coffee quite weak so we added an extra shot from the Nespresso machine.)The bathroom is clean with a good shower and a bidet as well. It'd be good if they had liquid hand soaps as it seems wasteful to have new soaps every day.We had a couple of slight niggles though... the bathroom was about to be fixed when we arrived. This didn't take too long but we were exhausted. Note - you cannot flush toilet paper down the toilet so there is a covered bin that you need to use. (This is quite normal in many parts of Europe.) They also installed double glazed windows while we were there so we had a slight wait to return to the room. The plus side is that the room is now incredibly quiet (which you'll need as there's an accordion player and a guitarist with 5 songs on permanent repeat - you'll know who I mean).Finally, we booked an early morning tour of the Vatican museums and Sistine Chapel through the manager, who did his best to get us the booking. Unfortunately, we waited over an hour and were never picked up. :( This is not the fault of staff at Palazzo de Cupis, but carefully research who you are going to do any tours with and book well ahead to avoid disappointment.Despite these minor niggles, it's a really good option and the guys who work there are friendly. They also had good recommendations for where to eat.","June 22, 2015","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

837,"The facilities were comprehensive, including a minibar with free soft drinks and the bed was large and very comfortable. The bathroom was modern and very clean. The breakfast was served in the room and was sufficient but didn't offer the choice that a hotel buffet might offer. The concierge service was excellent and very helpful.I would recommend getting them to book your taxi from the airport as it would be difficult to identify the entrance on first arriving.There is a bit of late evening noise as it overlooks the Piazza but this is worth putting up with for the view from the window.The central location meant we could easily walk to all the main attractions.","May 14, 2015","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

As you sit on the balcony the music,the people walking by, the sound of the fountains, the artist in the square, all add to the feeling of being a part of this beautiful eternal city! I can't imagine a better place to stay in Rome, The staff is amazing, and willing to meet all your needs. Breakfast is delivered to your room every morning on time, with the foods of your choice. Every primary attraction is within easy waling distance from this central location. So many family owned places to eat, just steps away. Water, and juice from mini bar where complimentary . coffee, and tea maker also available in your room. Beds where very comfortable, and the room was kept spotless every day.

Ideally located within walking distance of most of Rome's primary attractions, the lovely room #2 has a small balcony that is big enough for you and your significant other, a table, and a bottle of wine. Overlooking Piazza Navona, we spent morning, early evening and night watching the fascinating crowds in the Piazza. Artists and artisans, waiters, street vendors, musicians, joggers, priests and nuns, and tourists will keep you entertained as you relax from your long walks and tours of Rome attractions. There are wonderful restaurants very close by - outside the front door for instance. Be sure you take the 5 minute walk over to Campo di Fiori during the day for a delightful display of color and Roman personality. You will be taken care of by the staff as if you were royalty!

Loved our balcony overlooking Piazza Navona, which is great for people watching and enjoying our delicious breakfast which was served each morning to our room. The staff were all welcoming, friendly, polite and helpful, offering great advice on places we wanted to go and good restaurants to eat in of which there were many within a 5/10 minute walk away. Coffee, tea and soft drinks were freely available. The suites are very central, we walked to all the main attractions and really enjoyed discovering the not so popular areas of Rome too. Our bed was extra large and really comfy, we both had really good nights sleep. Wifi connection was free and fine, we had no problem connecting.Staying at Palazzo De Cupis was the icing on the cake for us after a busy day discovering Rome, we loved the fact that we were not returning to a busy hotel but to our beautiful relaxing room a real bonus.","April 3, 2015","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

The hotel was in the center of the city, if driving a car, think again, there is no parking close by, so you need to park 15+ minutes away and find your way to and from hotel. There are only three rooms, all very close together, and the lobby is in the middle so you can hear the other rooms very easily. The price for the value of the hotel is not worth it, if you're willing to pay this price, find a different place.","January 27, 2015","17    Palazzo De Cupis - Suites and View

855,"I stayed here October, 2018. Made reservations online for 141 Euros a night under the impression this was a hotel on Via Veneto. On arrival my same rooms were advertised for same period at 58 to 62 Euros a night. When I complained I was given a 2 Euro breakfast voucher. This was a monastery. It is very clean but only service is cleaning. Internet works in lob by not rooms. We asked for pillows and were told to come get them. They have no service other than checking in and limited cleaning. Better and cheaper to rent an apartment, they will give you more service. This was blindingly overpriced for a medium sized room with monastery décor. That is to say, nothing but one cross. It was very noisy and would have been OK for 60 Euros but I was taken to the cleaners price-wise with no recourse and every time I put on my computer, the hotel came up on Booking.com at less than 1/2 what I was paying. I guess those good reviews came from people not used to staying in actual hotels. This place should be listed as a pension not a hotel. They had some nerve charging me what they did. Not a holiday season or high season. I felt I had just thrown 350 Euros out the window. The only positive is that we found some good restaurants in the area. The place they sent us for breakfast sucked.","December 7, 2018","18    Casa I Cappuccini

The rooms are quite large and extremely clean and the bathroom and shower are excellent and super hygienic. The only thing I would say is missing is mirrors (we were three girls so it was important :D)We also met Rosa and Julia, two more amazing staff members. I have to mention that Rose helped us deal with random and tedious requests (even calling the Apple store and staying on hold for ages to help us book an appointment) while also having to deal with a terrible flu. She did all this with a smile and genuine interest in helping us.

My stay here was more so a negative experience because of what the people around me were saying - that the room looked like it was from the movie 'The Exorcism' and that during the night they had a HELP button glowing red. The bathroom light also turned off by itself when I was looking in the mirror, which totally freaked me out.Besides those aspects, our room only had 2 beds and there were three of us, so I had to sleep on a fold up bed with a rock hard mattress that was incredibly uncomfortable. The wifi was really dodgy so we had to sit around in the reception room to check our social media. Our windows also backed onto a large courtyard, so if someone else had their window open and was talking loudly it would echo. However, the hotel was conveniently located as it was only a short walk to the train/subway station, and there was a gelato store near the entrance of the building - which was a plus.","December 23, 2015","18    Casa I Cappuccini

874,"We stayed at I Cappuccini on October 8th for 5 nights. We were greeted by Rosa, with a big smile and treated us like we were friends. The rooms were as described, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was served in the restaurant in front of the hotel or across the street. The hotel was centrally located on Via Veneto next to Piazza Barberini where there is an entrance to the metro (5 minutes to Termini station or the Vatican). The Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain were about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Every morning Rosa would talk to us about our activities the day before and what we had planned for the day. Rosa gave us recommendations and even texted me to see if we found our way. Rosa introduced us to Gianbattista, whom I communicated with via email, and Gianbattista greeted us like old friends.With the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms, central location, and especially the warmth and friendliness of the staff made us happy that we stayed here and recommend this hotel. Next time we visit Rome we will definitely stay at I Cappuccini again.","October 25, 2015","18    Casa I Cappuccini

878,"We booked via an agency that handles accommodation in monasteries, although you can book this place through booking.com too. However, it isn't a standard hotel experience. There isn't a 24 hour reception (your room key also opens the front door), there is no room service, phone in the room or laundry, and wifi only in reception.Also, the conversion of the building is not yet complete, there were workmen still much in evidence on the ground floor when we stayed. However the room itself was beautiful and clearly there has been a lot of investment in high quality fixtures and fittings. The room was very spacious, tastefully and simply decorated. The bed was large and very comfortable. The floors were a lovely warm stone. Room and the splendid bathroom were spotlessly clean. It was also very quiet, despite being almost on top of Piazza Barberini, as it looked out over an internal courtyard. The whole place had a lovely calm atmosphere.Breakfast is at the Cafe Suggestum opposite. Unless you have a very sweet tooth ask for a plain croissant, otherwise you'll get one filled with custard, or even worse, Nutella.The staff were very welcoming and helpful and the place is extremely good value for money in an expensive city.","November 1, 2014","18    Casa I Cappuccini

879,"Located tumbling off the Barberini Metro Station, the lovely hotel is new and welcoming to the weary traveller on the wonderful via veneto. Trevi Fountain was quite close, Piazza Novona & Pantheon at a walkable distance. 1 metro stop away from Termini meant getting in was relatively easy.Room was well appointed with the much needed air con, comfortable beds, spacious bathrooms and clean linen. The staff was very friendly & sympathetic especially since my wallet was stolen near Porta Portese Flea market. The breakfast across the road at the cafe was adequate to kickstart the day..In Italy, you need room to stuff your tummy as well! Via Veneto itself is very charming and has a relaxed yet upmarket vibe. Do check out Villa Borghese gardens which are nearby.

Located next to the Capuchin Monastery, near the Piazza Barberini, on the Via Veneto, it is very well located. The rooms are spotless, the staff was helpful and kind.

Some of the rooms had additional beds in them. Breakfast was across the street at the Suggestum Cafe and consisted of juice, bakery item, and coffee or tea. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. Laura, at the front desk, was very helpful and patient with us. We arrived around 10 am and were able to check-in as the rooms were already available. Locations is good--next door to the Barberini Metro stop and the buses stop out front. The rate we paid was better than anything else I found and my charge card wasn't charged to hold the rooms until a few days before arrival. I would go back.","May 23, 2014","18    Casa I Cappuccini

882,"Just completed our trip to Europe with a stay at the Hotel Colosseum and we were a walk or bus away from all of the wonderful sights we planned to visit. Great value and clean rooms. Diego and Massimo at the reception desk were courteous and kind in helping us navigate the area. They even arranged in advance for a larger taxi to pick up our group of four with luggage - the driver offered interesting and insightful information about Rome as we made our way to the airport. Breakfast offered a wide array of options for any palate and the staff in the dining room was friendly and welcoming. Can't say enough about the rooftop area to see beautiful Rome in the late afternoon and evening (temps were very hot whilst there). Lots of wonderful restaurants near the hotel as well. If you plan to join a tour of Vatican City or the Museums from the hotel, either by bus or taxi, plan on lots of walking and extra time to get to your meeting point. We were a half hour late to our meeting point, so missed the guided tour and had to walk around on our own.

We also appreciated the complimentary luggage storage as we arrived much earlier then check in time and we departed late in the evening.

Also only a few steps up from our room to the lovely rooftop bar and terrace. We loved relaxing and taking in the view here with cold drink. The location was very good. Front desk was great about calling taxis for anyplace too far to walk and they were there in minutes. Also taxis were not too expensive which was nice.

The receptionist was kind and arranged a room 2 hours before our check in time. After 13 hours of travel and 4 hours of waiting in the lounge, we were very much disappointed at the first glance of our room. It just fitted our luggage and there was no space to walk around. The room was extremely small and so was the size of television which was more like a computer screen. There was not much staff and therefore we had to go down to the reception to collect the things we wanted like plates and spoons.

We chose the hotel partly of location, but walking from the Termini was not quite as easy (due to the slopes/stairs). However, upon checkout we decided to walked to the Cavour Metro station and then took the train (1 stop) to Termini, which was much easier. Shops and restaurants are nearby along the main road, and indeed, the Colosseum isn't very fair either. Off the main road, so it's relatively quite. Rooms are clean and comfortable enough.

It's between the main train station and the Colosseum up a hill.-The view on the terrace was nice, but I would not chose the hotel for this reason. You get better views from other buildings/cathedrals. You can just about make out the Colosseum.-the room and bathrooms were nice and large. The walls however quite thin. We were woken up every morning by someone showering and scrubbing? At 5.45 am.-Breakfast- nothing to complain about.

914,"Just back form a few days in Rome. We stayed in this very good hotel and had a very enjoyable and pleasant stay. As the name suggests it's within walking distance from the Colosseum on a quiet street off via Carvour. Via Carvour itself within walking distance from the main railway station, Termini. Staff were very helpful, Thank you Diego for researching some restaurants/areas to eat for us on our last night. Our room was a little a small but adequate, we were out so much we just needed a place to put our heads at night The room was very well service for us on our return after a long day exploring Rome. Very decent breakfast, clean dining room and smiling staff genuinely wishing you Buon Giorno !All in all, I think the title above covers this great hotel in Rome - try it !","April 29, 2019","19    Hotel Colosseum

915,"Hotel Colosseum Rome delivers what it promises. It provides a comfortable base to explore ancient Rome and is about half a kilometer from the train station as well as the colosseum itself (we could see the top of the colosseum from our fifth floor room). the parthenon neighborhood is a couple of kilometers away so you'll likely need public transport to get there. There are two metro stops a couple of blocks from the hotel. Adequate places to eat also a couple of blocks away on the main drags as well as off the piazza facing the basilica nearby. Our room faced East so in the morning you could open the double shutter style windows and let the sun in while looking out over the tile rooftops; quite pleasant. The neighborhood was quiet at night (although the Blue Moon strip joint is around the corner). rooms are an adequate size, euro efficient, clean with high ceilings and good bathrooms (very small shower). Believe the property is seven floors with a tiny elevator that won't operate with more than four bodies on board. A white marble staircase runs from the lobby to the top floor terrace. Compact lobby with adjoining public room/bar. Breakfast room is a good size and offerings are adequate with juices, coffee, scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries, some cereals and pastries; need more fruit selection. All front desk & breakfast staff are accommodating and helpful. Enjoyed our three nights.Sam & KathyVancouver, Canada","April 27, 2019","19    Hotel Colosseum

916,"We were attracted to this hotel because of the rooftop bar that’s open all year round and although the views were amazing - it was a little too chilly to stay up there for too long (the blankets up there were very much appreciated!) The hotel itself was absolutely spotless and ideally located in a quieter neighbourhood of Rome however not far away to be able to walk to a number of great restaurants, bars/pubs, gelato places / bakeries and shops / supermarkets. Also only a 10 minute walk to the colosseum and Roman Forum. We stayed on the 2nd floor and had a little balcony which made a good addition when we opened up the doors as the rooms are fairly compact but in saying that, they had enough space for our 4 night stay. We found the bed extremely comfortable and extra pillows / blanket were in the room if needed. Our room had a small in-room safe (not large enough for an iPad), tea and coffee facilities and a hairdryer. The shower was great and always hot and in its separate room and I liked the green marble look to the bathroom. Breakfast was lovely, although it was a continental breakfast there was plenty of choice and also the addition of bacon and scrambled egg which was a nice surprise. The two ladies that worked the breakfast shift were very friendly and attentive. The rest of the staff we came across were also welcoming and happy to help with organising airport transport and also giving recommendations. A big Thankyou to all the staff and especially to Diego who kept us entertained and topped up with drinks until the early hours of the morning. A great base on a city trip to Rome.

920,"My friend and I decided to head to Rome for a short break as she received a new bag for Christmas. Opted for the Hotel Colosseum. The roof top terrace was an attraction as the city views looked amazing. We were not disappointed.We arrived via Terravision bus transfer from the airport, drop off at Termini station and took the short walk to the hotel.The hotel is welcoming, staff are friendly and give useful information. Our room albeit on the snug side had the basics which all functioned as they should and was clean! The room did have a safe, not a combination lock but with a key. It is 3star so not luxury but covers all the basics well. It is a central location with easy access to attractions on foot. Colosseum, Sant Maria Maggiore, train station, hop on hop off bus root, we also walked to the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain from there. Also a good selection of places to eat within easy reach.With the central location comes city noise, our room was at the front of the hotel and even though the hotel is located in a side street it can still be noisy. Mainly Friday night for us. It was eased by closing the window.Breakfast was typical continental style.For a city break the hotel is in a great location, the staff are very pleasant and helpful and overall I would recommend it and happily stay again.","April 14, 2019","19    Hotel Colosseum

It’s easier to walk everywhere in Rome and from here we walked to Restaurants, the Coloseum, Trevi, Pantheon and Capitale Museum. There are no views from the rooms however there is a rooftop bar area with great views of Rome. No fridge in room, no room service, no meals except breakfast - bar available anytime. Small bathroom - might be a challenge for larger folk. Breakfast was good range of continental/European plus bacon and scrambled eggs. I recommend this hotel for a mid range priced hotel.

937,"We originally picked this hotel due to it's location, it's about 10 minutes walk from the Colosseum and has the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore at the end of the road. There is also a Tiger (Flying Tiger) nearby if, like me, you forget your charger cable. We arrived before the check in time but the hotel has a room where you can leave your bags so that's exactly what we did and then went off for our first exploration of the city of Rome. Later in the day we returned to check in and the greeting was friendly and a porter showed us to our room on the 7th floor (lift is available). The room was big enough and clean with a nice clean bathroom and includes tea/coffee making facilities. The linen on the bed was clean, as were the towels and some wash products were also provided (soap & shower gel). We had what I consider to be a nice view out over the roofs of Rome so the windows were opened and we had a coffee.  The view from the rooftop was also nice, although it was a little breezy for us so didn't stay long. We had a little problem finding where to plug in our chargers until I realised they are just behind the bed side tables. The room also has a safe (free of charge), TV, a double wardrobe with hangers, a hairdryer and a chair. Extra pillows/blankets were in the cupboard above the wardrobe. The rooms come with breakfast which included the usual cereal/eggs/bacon/toast along with fruit, yoghurts, pastries and juice so, as vegetarians, there was plenty for us to select from. The room was cleaned every day and we always found the staff to be friendly and helpful.

938,"Hotel Colossaeum is a very old 3 star hotel. We were not really expecting great things. However the hotel was quite charming. The room was pleasant, with clean sheets a powerful shower and coffee making facilcities (added after some of the reviews we read). We stayed in February and the room temperature was perfect. We suspect it may be quite hot in the middle of the summer.The breakfast restaurant provided a good start to the day, and the roof terrace was perfect for those in-between times before going out in the evening. Perfect or a little sun worship or reading a book. The staff were extremely helpful, showing all the sites in the map and explaining some of the tips locals use on the busses. The location was great - within 10 minutes walk of the central rail/bus station (Termini) and within easy wak of the Colossum and the Roman Forum. Lots of good restaurants near as well. Not too expensive either.We opted for a shared shuttle from the Airport to the Hotel, which was good as we arrived late and the last trains are at 11:30pm. If you arrive early then the train is much quicker and less bumpy and only 10 minutes walk away. All in all, highly recommended for a 2-3 night visit.","March 1, 2019","19    Hotel Colosseum

Arrived prior to the 2pm check in but wasn't an issue to leave our bags in the dedicated room so we could head out to explore. We had a room on the fifth floor overlooking the city for me and my wife which was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was a good choice between cereals, fruit, cold meat and cheese with some bacon, scrambled eggs and sausages. Staff are all very helpful and pleasant.Top tips - The metro is 5 minutes away, head out, turn right and follow the road down. Take another left and walk down the road to the Metro. If you plan on going to Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Vatican you need the station on the right and go to Termini Station (One stop away) before changing. It's very easy and if you are buying a ticket make sure you have coins or a 5 euro note, nothing bigger.If heading to the Colosseum you can walk, it's on 10 minutes away.Forgot to mention, when you walk to the metro you'll pass a supermarket on your right for cheap supplies.","February 26, 2019","19    Hotel Colosseum

941,"Goldmine of a hotel and at worst, a €15 taxi to St Peter’s Sq. A comfortable walk to the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and many other beautiful sights. The ‘hop on - hop off’ buses are a rip off, and independent and in no way connected to the Hotel. The Hotel Colosseum clearly states 3*, but in our own experience, we think its worthy of another star. It is spotlessly clean, our room was cleaned every day and not one thing of ours (iPads etc) were touched except to clean under, then replaced. We forgot to put euros back in the safe in the room, before heading out for the day, the room was gutted as usual and the clear bag containing the euros hadn’t even been touched. Don’t let photos of the low pillows mislead you,(which I was dreading) but they are actually very comfortable. I doubled up but was genuinely more comfortable with the one pillow. And the huge bed was also extremely comfortable. The ladies in the breakfast room were absolute stars. They simply could not do enough for the guests. But the unsung heroes of the hotel are the maids who change our beds and cleaned our room, shower room and toilet room every single day.Sadly we didn’t get to experience the rooftop lounge as I was a little unwell the night we intended to go up. (Nothing to do with food etc to clarify - an underlying condition that decided to play up!).When we return to Rome, (which as the legend states, if you throw coins from your right hand over your left shoulder into the Trevi Fountain, you’re sure to return to Rome soon) we will definitely book into the Hotel Colosseum again.

Coffee service in our room was great as breakfast generally didn’t start till 0730. However, the morning we departed (early), there was another early departure and breakfast was up and going before 0730. That was very nice. Floors 5, 6 & 7 will give you great views.

953,"Third visit to Hotel Colloseum, for 5 nights, we arrived late morning, room not ready, but not a problem, we left our cases in storage, and went to retrace favourite places and walks. Staff at the front desk are always helpuful and ready to answer questions, give directions etc. We had a lovely room with balcony, and lots of space. Hotel warm and comfortable, room was spotlessly clean, fresh towels and sheets most days, and we even had a kettle and tea/coffee which was an absolute welcome bonus. Breakfast is continental breakfast with plenty of choice and lovely coffee. The hotel is situated a short walk from the Colloseum and not far from the termini. There are plenty of resteraunt nearby with good quality food, and a supermarket down the road also if you just want a buffet on the roof terrace etc. What can I say, I love this hotel, I'm sure we'll be back there soon. Thank you hotel Colloseum for making our trip great!","February 12, 2019","19    Hotel Colosseum

954,"Thank you to all the staff and management at this wonderful hotel. 10 minute walk to the colesseum and 10 minutes to Termini train station. Very clean and friendly. So easy to get to the rugby. Oh, one tip for the rugby, there is a small coffee shop/bar half way on on the main road to the stadium. Every round of beer we had, they fed us bread, meat and sometimes chips. Didn't need to eat anything else. (Although my wife sampled their wonderful lasagne).We will be back.","February 10, 2019","19    Hotel Colosseum

955,We travelled from da Vinci airport by train to the main Termini station in Rome. This was €14 each one way. We used google maps to locate the hotel which was easy enough to find even in the pouring rain. Was around a 10min walk. We had arrived around noon but rooms weren’t ready until 2pm. We could leave our bags in storage. We ate in a nearby restaurant called Le Base which was very busy but nice food and fairly reasonable. Once we were able to check in Diego was helpful. Our room was quite small but clean and was serviced daily although I don’t think it was necessary to leave fresh towels daily. The single beds moved apart easily and IMO were quite small. The room got quite warm at night but there is AC. The breakfast offers a range of continental items and is more than adequate. The location of the hotel is excellent and is in walking distance to many sites. We didn’t use the rooftop although I did have a look and it would be nice in summer. I probably wouldn’t stay here again just due to the small single beds but if that isn’t an issue for you then I would recommend it.,"February 5, 2019","19    Hotel Colosseum

963,Hotel Colosseum is astually that close the Colosseum but it is a very nice hotel. It's on a quiet street off Via Cavour. Close to the metro so getting round Rome is easy. Breakfast is simple buffet but good. The room was clean with a nice shower. The best thing is the roof terrace. The roof terrace bar obviously isn't open in winter but the views are fantastic.

When I called down to a pot of tea, and water, I was charged. Otherwise, the stay was good. The hotel was clean and the staff courteous and very helpful in terms of recommending tours and restaurants. This was my first Roman holiday and the hotel was smack in the middle of a 20-minute walk to most of the sites.

The hotel does not have catering or facilities for making tea/ coffee in the room which is something that could be looked into, although they do serve drinks and the complementary cold breakfast is adequate. The best part of the hotel is its location which is just 10 minutes walking from the Colosseum. The staff are also quite helpful and polite.

966,So I stayed here for a couple of nights and was comfortable enough rooms were clean and had a good shower in the room! The breakfast was ok pretty basic but enough for me! There’s not much going on in the hotel or at least when I was there (November) it has a great rooftop terrace with some pretty amazing views! The location is great and only a 5/10 min stroll to the colosseum and that leads you to everything else so I found it very good value for money! There are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants close to the hotel and the hop on hop off bus (BIG BUS) stops very close to the hotel if your legs have had enough walking for one day!

Hey, this ain't no swanky 5 star hotel but then again it doesn't profess to be. What the hotel is is clean,reasonably priced and well positioned to use as a base. The room we had was spacious, furniture is basic and that's fine, we went to Rome to see the sites, not the bedroom ceiling. The bathroom (which is always the first room I review before choosing where to stay) was very clean, towels being changed every day without prompt. We think the bed linen was changed every other day during our 5 night stay. Staff were very courteous, nothing too much trouble. Breakfast was continental, which you'd expect.

974,"My husband and I stayed in Casa di Silvia in late May/early June this year, and we were so happy with this place! It is very close to the next metro stop, but we are healthy and active and liked to walk to the Colloseum every morning and continued walking to the different sights from there. The price is excellent for the proximity to the inner city. All of the staff were very friendly. There was a yong woman at the reception, Iuliana, who gave us very good advice on how to get around the city and which sights not to miss. The other staff also were very sweet and friendly.The room was clean and comfortable and had a fridge that was stocked with water, juice and milk, and we got tea and little snacks like cookies & pastry for free. The building was very old-fashioned and beautiful and the nights were quiet (which is very important to me).The only thing I wasn't 100% happy with was the breakfast - the room was too small for all guests and the food on offer was very plain - but on the other hand, this is a B&B and not a hotel, and for the price it was okay.We'll definitely stay here again next time we return to Rome!","October 25, 2016","20    Casa di Silvia

The rooms are well kept and clean, stocked with a mini fridge, TV, hairdryer, safe, and ensuite bathroom. Silvia was extremely accommodating and helpful. She answered any and all questions we had for her and helped me and my friend plan the best routes to see all the sights. The B&B is located about 7 minutes from the metro in case you don't feel like walking around, although you get to see much more of Rome if you choose to walk. The breakfast room is open every morning from 8-9:30 where you can enjoy a classic Italian breakfast as well a nice chat with Silvia; who is there every morning making sure you're enjoying your stay. When it was time for us to leave she arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport. The average cost from Rome to Fiumicino is usually about 50 euros but with Silvia we got it for 45.

Our room, and more importantly bed, was very comfortable and clean. My partner was pregnant and the bed was plenty big enough for the 3 of us. The en suite shower was lovely and there are tea/coffee making facilities in reception. The property is part of a gated complex and felt very safe-we had no problems with noise either. We didnt bother with breakfast-opting for cappuccino and home made croissants in a local bar instead for just 1.50. And then there is Guilia-such a wonderful host. She made contact before we arrived and made sure we knew we could contact her if needed at any point. After welcoming us she offered advice and tips for our stay and then gave us our own keys so we could just get on and explore. She will arrange transport to/from the airport but we opted to get a bus to the main station and then metro from there (30mins from the airport, 5 mins on the metro-very simple and much cheaper).

It had two single beds stuck together to make a double bed (which was surprisingly comfortable) and two singles.However, with hindsight I wish I had booked a separate room, as we did need our own space. But this was my fault really.The room did get noisy if you opened the windows, but once we shut them and asked for the fan switch we were able to sleep contently.The breakfast was okay, if you have a sweet tooth, which luckily or unluckily e I do, but could've done with healthier options such as fruit or unsweetened muesli. However, there is a supermarket nearby and a fridge in the room to store your fruit in.The landlady Juliana is a hardworking and helpful lady who did her best to make things comfortable for us.

Let's get the easy part out of the way first, Julia is simply wonderful. From the time she sent a cab to bring us from the airport until we left via the same transport, Julia made our stay extra special. Nothing was too much trouble for her and her infectious enthusiasm is the perfect tonic to start your day in Roma. Rooms are cleaned every day, but if you'd prefer to sleep late (15 year olds) then Julia will keep her distance and leave you some fresh towels. The room was fantastic, hot water in the shower and the all important WiFi (15 year olds) worked really well.The Casa Di Silvia is situated near the San Giovanni Basilica, Metro station is a two minute walk away. This is a quieter neighbourhood where the locals stay so you get the real flavor of Roma. Julia will help with places to eat and drink; within a ten minute stroll from the B&B you can enjoy at least a dozen restaurants.

987,"At first it seemed like aika nice place, for the very first evening. The place was not easy to find in dark but after finding place things got smooth. Unfortunately we found out the very first night that the ventilator in bathroom was not powerful enough for four people showering and the room got humid as the bathroom was like a cold steamroom. Partly because of that room got cold at night and I woke up with sore throat.While looking for the place we were informed by the booking site that room has a ceiling fan and air con. No fan and the air con not usable. We contacted Giuliana to consult her but all she said was: ""Look, the room is hot and the air conditioner is for summers only."" When trying to continue her about the problem Giuliana repeted her words and cut me off the line. Couple days later we run to her on the street and all she could do was to complain why didn't we come to her before like she'd heard this all first time just then. We asked to use the air con even for 30min after showering even with cold air but were denied. Giuliana only rolled her eyes and started to explain about her home and every house in Italy facing the same situation. Seriously, the air is so humid that even the wallpaper is sticky glue getting through of it.The booking site and confirmation also pointed the beds to have selkeät comfort mattresses. Out of two single beds and one double bed only the other single had. Other were with hard strings. Surely the beddings are also not ""top end quality"" but worn and even sligthly broken. Room did have fridge which was very convenient. Electric waterkettle was common for all the rooms and very much dated with no automatical switch off and water leaking off the bottom when in use. There was also no place to wash used cups. For our last night the kettle disappeared thou'.Room was spacious and pretty well cleaned with normal (a standard worldwide) dust under the bed. Room was also nicely renovated and a huge plus for four glazed windows! It also had a hairdrier but it was taken from us the last day because we had used it to dry couple pairs of socks which we urgently needed and would have otherwise taken 48 hours to dry. Yeah, we tried the old fashion way. Okay, no hairdrier but that game was so childish that if this is their way to handdle differencies (cut off the line, take hairdrier away) then these girls still have a lot to learn about business.Without Giulianas childish and unpolite behaviour when facing problems with a paying customer I would have rated the place better. Also we were not satisfied with the other girl who obviously had no interest to first open the locked safebox (locked when we arrived) and explain us how it works (no introduction in the room). You are most likely well off in this place if you have no complaints. The location could be better but our children were okay to walk from Vatican to here so you should be okay too.If you travel with kids remember children under 10 don't pay city tax. We were asked to pay at first for a 7 year old but Giuliana fixed it when we told he should not pay.The last note: If you are allergic to scents or dogs find another place. Dogs are welcome and they use a very strong scent in the corridor. Seriously, the smell is worse than in a parfumeria. Just a note for those whom it might be a real problem.","January 6, 2016","20    Casa di Silvia

998,"We stayed at Casa di Silvia after reading all the positive reviews of Tripadvisor - and I'm so glad we did! We are a couple in our mid 20's, visiting Rome for the weekend on a reasonably tight budget. The stay was everything we could have asked for.All I can really do is echo what other reviews have said about the owner Giuliana - she was an amazing host. Our flight from Gatwick got delayed and we had a nightmare getting there from the airport, meaning we didn't arrive until 1.30am local time - not only did she wait up for us but as she couldn't be there in the morning she took the time to draw on a map all the places she would recommend we visit. We ended up relying on her map more than the guide book!Room was ideal for what we wanted and fantastic value for money, cleaned daily and included most mod-cons like hairdryer, Wi-Fi, TV etc. in room cost. Breakfast was simple, but very much did the job. Location wise, although it's not bang in the middle of the Centro Storico, all major attractions were in walkable distance. We only got on the metro once all weekend, to get to Vatican City, and even then we walked back from there (it was a bit of a trek though!).I would absolutely recommend Casa di Silvia to anyone who wants to see Rome without forking out for a plush hotel room. If you read this Giuliana, thanks once again for a wonderful and memorable stay - we hope to see you again sometime!","January 31, 2015","20    Casa di Silvia

Enough choices for breakfast, and very attentive maid, but she was too close… I mean more self service would be nice. More than helpful reception )))) when we weren't sure about anything such as directions, schedules and open hours, Giulia took the time to search places for us online, and gave us all possible information.

1001,"We booked our Stay for a total of 5 nights at Casa di Silvia.The owner, Iuliana was so extremely friendly that we felt at home right from the start.She gave us a map of the city center and told us how to get to all the different tourist landmarks which proved to be quite useful as we came to the city quite unprepared. She was also so kind to recommend the best Italian restaurant we've ever been to which was 2 minutes away from the B&B. it was a nice family owned restaurant without any toursist and with amazing food. We ended up eating there every evening for the whole stay in rome.The room was quite spatious and had a view on the inner garden which was really calm and quiet at night. The Bathroom and the Bedroom itself were extremely clean and tidy. Breakfast was served in the room and was very good. It included cereals, croissants and as many toast with jam as we wanted. Also there was a huge variety of coffee, tea and biscuits available any time of the day you wanted. We had read, that booking some trips in advance would be a huge help especially for the Vatican, in order to skip the line. Iualiana helped us with the booking and printed our tickets. This was sooooo helpful and totally worth booking in advance, once you see the line there is to get into the vatican Museum. The location was great, as it was not in the historical center of rome where you could avoid all the tourists but still get to the center in a very short time. The colloseum was a 10-15 minute walk away (depending on your pace) and the rest could easily be walked to. alternatively there was a very convenient metro Station 3-4 minutes away from the B&B which lets you get to any tourist attration within a few minutes. All in all the price/ Location ratio was extremely good!! I can only say positive things about the service, location and amenities. If you are looking for a budget friendly stay in rome with excellent hospitality and the best host you can imagine then you should definiltely contact Iuliana.Also, listen to all the recommendations she gives. They have all proven to be extremely useful and made our trip all the more worth while as we skipped quite some lines and saved quite a lot of money. This is definitely a place I want to return to one day!","October 6, 2014","20    Casa di Silvia

1002,"We originally looked for a place like this for a very long time and picked it mainly because the area looked clean and was near historical sites. We were very pleased with the neighborhood which is basic Rome, busy yet interesting. The location was very good right next to a small convenience store, a little bar/cafe and some other things including two Metro stations. There is actually a Saturday local market not too far which is far better than the tourist one in central Rome. It is a great local and access is easy.But to the best part....the little B&B run by Juliana the best host anyone can imagine. She is without a doubt the most caring and enthusiastic host we had. We wanted to take her home with us. She is sweet, but efficient, attentive but caring. This young lady places her whole heart into this operation and its attention to detail. The room was great, the service beyond compare, wonderful breakfast we could never finish and served in our room. What a great find. I really recommend this as opposed to something right in the center of Rome, it has easy access to all the sites , but you can find the real Rome here too...walking the streets, seeing how they live.

1005,"Our first met with the host was a disaster! I don’t feel the hospitality! We understood we might make a mistake that caused her trouble, we apologised; there was no need kept on repeating, nagging and lecturing us during out first met conversation! We are not barbarian! Her attitude as such was really spoiled our holiday mood! My family felt unhappy with this kind of service!The B&B owner not even introduce herself but unhappy, kept on complaining we did not inform her our arrival time, not answer her emails, she had been waiting us for hours blah blah blah during our first met. I have stayed in other B&B before, the hospitality of the previous host and so many positive reviews of this B&B in Tripadvisor made my decided to stay in this B&B. But, the attitude of this host was eyes opened for me!We reserved rooms in this B&B via Booking.com. There is no information mentioned that the B&B guests have to inform the host their arrival time neither in Booking.com nor B&B website. We were extremely busy with work until the day before our vacation. Rome was not the first stop during our vacation. How can we answer email during our vacation as the check-in time mentioned in Booking.com is from 13:00 to 20:00?She not in a good mood to give us a ""nice"" introduction for example the interesting places to visit; she was circling the places on the map in light speed as she just wants to get rid of us. During the premises explanation tour, she did not miss a chance to satirise us for not checking and answering her emails, reminding us this is not a hotel but B&B, lecturing us what differences between a hotel and B&B, nagging how tired she was as she had to woke up at 6am because a group of guests arrived at around 6am blah, blah, blah.Is this the way a B&B host treated their guests? We actually looking forward the host will recommended us places for a budget and good meals, but her attitude made us no mood to have more conversation and the rest period of our stay.We did not have a good night sleep during out stay. The rooms are a big nightmare for light sleepers like us; we ended up sleep with earplugs! In Booking.com, it mentions the rooms are soundproofing. No, they are not! The traffic noise can be heard clearly as early as 6am with windows closed tight, the conversation of others can be heard clearly even the rooms are facing the yard. This is not soundproof room!In Booking.com, it says rooms are air-conditioned. No, it is an air cooler instead air conditional, and generating bloody loud noise. The host informed us Italians sleep with windows open, there is no need any air conditioning. She has the air cooler unit in the room just because of the tourists. Yes, she is expecting all her B&B guests should sleep like Italians.The worst, when the air cooler was turned on, no other electronic devices should be plugged in the power plugs. If not, the whole floor will be black up.This B&B is near to metro line A, about 5 minutes walking distance from the San Giovanni metro station. The B&B rooms are facing to a yard.The size of double bedrooms is reasonably big; the room facilities are basic, and a mini bar in the room. The toilet, bathroom and toiletries are standard.The breakfast is served in the room; the host prepares and brings the breakfast to the room in the morning between 8 to 9:30am. An early breakfast can be arranged. The breakfast is basic; the breakfast coffee is not freshly brewed but instant coffee.I rarely wrote strong negative review about hotels & B&B I stayed, as I believe owners have their difficulties for fulfilling every requirement from their guests. However, this B&B host was really ruined our stay and vacation!","August 8, 2014","20    Casa di Silvia

1008,"After reading the reviews here and on anther web site, there as no way I could go wrong right? WRONG! Lets start with location. OK not too bad. The neighborhood is heavily covered in graffiti. It's still more like a 25-30 walk to Colosseum and not the 10 to 15 as advertised. pretty close to the Metro so that is a plus. Julia is a welcoming host. Showed us to our room, the 5 keys needed (front gate, building , B&B door, room and bathroom) but all in all pretty decent. Julia was helpful with many things especially our lost bag. What would a trip to Rome be without lost luggage. In fact. it was a carry on that Air Canada decided was too big to fit ( thats another story al together tho!) She called the airport a few times to aid in getting our bag returned. (WARNING no matter how much anyone says they will deliver your luggage, its up to you to go to the airport and get them)The ""fun"" began when we went to sleep. Yes its July in Rome so its warm. The ceiling was about 15 feet up with a ceiling fan.. great. too bad it was so small that, not only did it not cool the room, but we couldn't even feel the breeze. Cant open the steel shutters because we are on the first floor and we were told ""this is Rome, so shut them at night"" So it was hot... bad hot. Ok lets get some sleep. Our room was across the courtyard from Julianas flat. Which means our window opened to the street. and oh what a busy street. Cars, trucks, motorcycles, trash collection and then around 2:30 till 3:15 or so.. a group of Italians having a conversation VERY loudly on the corner. Well they might as well been in our rom they were so loud. Needless to say we didn't sleep well and could not wait to get out of the place. A quick yogurt and coffee and we were on our way. Also had to pay cash since she does not have a credit card machine.Although Julia is great, I can not recommend this B&B","July 1, 2014","20    Casa di Silvia

We reached her B&B late at night. She was waiting for us and personally escorted us to our room and considering we had not made any special request we were pleasantly surprised she had read our needs and allocated a large room to us since we were traveling with our 13 year old son to ensure our comfort. She took a lot of pains explaining everything. She even sat down at the late hour and chalked out our itinerary for the next three days, with how to reach major Rome attractions, what to see, which metro lines to take, etc. even recommending how not to waste money on buying drinking water (there are plenty of drinking water fountains available throughout the city). She helped us in ironing out some problems we were having with our car hire agency and organized a taxi for us to their office when it was time for us to leave giving us a very warm and loving sendoff.

1011,"For my husband and I, staying in this B&B was the highlight of our 3 city trip- and was our favorite place to stay out of all the places we have been in Europe (several countries and cities since moving to Germany a year ago)! We LOVE this B&B for so many reasons- but the top reason being the wonderful owner (I don't know how to spell her name so I won't even attempt it!). She honestly feels just like a good friend and takes care of you like you're family. From the improvements throughout the B&B she has made (German double-pane windows to take care of noise, complimentary cakes/tea/coffee out all the time, special lighting in the bathroom for makeup, etc.) to all of her personal assistance daily (constant communication through apps, breakfast in our fridge the morning we left early for the airport, restaurant recommendations, great conversations, etc.), it is easy to tell that she truly cares about her guests and her business. You can not go wrong staying at this B&B just for these facts alone. Add in the great area of the B&B, near San Giovanni, filled with nice shops, cafes, gelaterias, trattorias, etc. a metro stop right down the street, and the easy 15 minute walk to the Colosseum, and you literally can not pick a better place to stay in Rome. If you have any other questions: Yes, the beds are comfy, yes the area is safe (and inside a gated community), yes the breakfast is filling, and no, there is nothing lacking!

Honestly, I enjoyed my stay here at Casa di Silvia more. I had a lovely big room, with a private bathroom- both were incredibly clean, far cleaner than the usual hotels. The host, Iuliana, is an amazing and inspirational girl who has both the charisma and ability to run this little gem both efficiently & professionally and yet, there's a personal touch to it that makes it unique. In a city which is more commonly known for it's inefficient and chaotic approach to everything, I cannot emphasise enough how impressed i was with this little oasis of privacy and calm. The location is right in the centre in one of the more posh areas of Rome, and you can easily walk it to the Coliseum from there. I will definitely be returning. So go ahead and book, because you will not be disappointed by this seductive combination of simplicity, privacy and value. Thank Iuliana, a presto! FabioC","April 5, 2014","20    Casa di Silvia

I would definitely recommend this B&B to anyone who goes to Rome.PS: if every room in this B&B had a tiny kettle - it woulbe be paradise ^_^ Love Iuliana!","January 3, 2014","20    Casa di Silvia

1014,"All the reviews are right, we just had such a great stay at casa di silvia! The location is great, three minute walk to the metro and 20 minute leisurely walk to the colosseum! Great breakfast (I meant to take a picture but it's cereal, yoghurt, toast, coffee juice and croissants in your bedroom), cookies and drinks in the reception area were lovely! The woman who runs it is very helpful and accommodating! I would definitely stay here again, perfect for the price.

1015,Julianna makes this B&B like going to a friends home for the vacation. She was very helpful and generous. There was always tea and a freshly baked cake around for any evening cravings. The room was a bit small for me and my family of four but the greetings and the location definitely compensated for that. The location is across the street from the bus station 85 at Rimini street. This bus takes you past many of the main sites. About 500 meters from the B&B there is the Metro station as well. The colosseum is about a 15 minute walk away.,"October 22, 2013","20    Casa di Silvia

1016,"My wife and I stayed at Casa Di Silvia for 4 days in early October. The facility itself is very nice, located on first floor of the building. There is an elevator, but since you only have to go up a few stairs, you may not need it. Our room was very clean and fairly large as European B&Bs go. Bathroom was nice and also a bit larger and it actually had places to set your toiletries. The place is located in a mostly residential area and has a beutiful courtyard between the gate and the entrance to the building.The location is excellent, within a block or so of the San Giovani Metro station and walking distance to the most of the main sights. We did use the Metro to Visit the Vatican, but walked to most of the others. if you prefer not to walk, Metro service is easy to Spanish steps and Trevi fountain, as well as to Train station. Walk was easy to Forum and colosium.The real highlight of this B&B, though, is Giulia, the owner/operator. We have stayed at quite a number of similiar establishments throughout Spain and Italy and she is by far the nicest, warmest, most helpful and enthusiastic person we have met. I am not including details and directions in this review because I know that Giulia will explain and show you, give you maps, draw you maps, and do what ever it takes to get you where you want to go. She speaks fluent English, by the way. I should mention too that she serves an excellent breakfast by European B&B standards, with all the coffee you want. She really is the best and you will just have to go and meet her to appreciate what I am trying to describe. This is an excellent value and a great experience.We left feeling that we had made a friend for life.","October 14, 2013","20    Casa di Silvia

1017,"I stayed in Casa Di Silvia with my mum for 4 days on the beginning on September. We came from a 3 star hotel in Venice and with the hurry we forgot our money and passports on the safe. We realised about it when we arrived in Rome, called them several times but the hotel management refused to go and check the safe and help us getting our documents back.We told Iuliana (the manager of Casa di Silvia) about this traumatic experience, she took her mobile and made few calls to the hotel. It went back and forth for few hours and at the end she managed to get a courier with our documents. Love at first sight!!! Iuliana is a caring, helpful hostess, amazing customer service. The B&B is centrally located, 5 min walk from the tube station, in a quiet neighbourhood, all recently refurbished and super clean!

1023,"Rome was made that little bit better just by staying at this B&B as Guilia made us feel very welcome and was very helpful in explaining how to get to the places we wanted to visit. She brought a breakfast (consisting of cheese, bread, cereal, biscuits, yogurt, tea & juice) into our room every morning and recommended local places to eat. The room was cheaper than I thought it was going to be for accommodation right in the centre of Rome. If you'd prefer to stay with the locals in a block of flats (think Amelie) rather than a large commercial hotel chain this is the place for you. The rooms are spacious, clean, colourful and just look like a bedroom at home. The place is definitely secure needing a variety of keys to enter the building (once the gate at the front is closed at night) and there was also wi-fi available too for those who want to message those back home. There is no air-con just a fan but that did the job!I thought the location was good too as it was only a few minutes walk from the Colosseum and the ancient part of town, and the metro was literally down the street, which took you straight to the Vatican city. I'd stay here again if I came back to Rome as it was value for money.","July 24, 2013","20    Casa di Silvia

1025,"I just wanted to take a minute and recommend this wonderful B&B in the heart of Rome.Casa di Silvia was everything I was looking for in accommodation during my stay in Rome. This Bed and Breakfast is inexpensive, well furnished, spacious and clean. The owner Juliana is a wonderful, smiling, caring, hard working individual who does everything possible to make sure both your stay and your trip are enjoyable . She provided me with a map, recommended local eateries and made sure I knew where I was going. In fact it was the positive reviews of Juliana that were the deciding factor in my choice to stay here. I can't say enough nice things about this person as she really helped me out during my stay and it was a pleasure to have met her.Each room has a lovely new renovated private bathroom w/ shower, flat panel T.V., small dining area, closet/hangers, mini fridge, room safe, iron/board (upon request), fully opening windows and locking doors. The rooms are a perfect size for one or two people and can accommodate up to four. The B&B itself is located in a secure building of a secure courtyard just outside the Aurelian Wall near St. John Lateran's Archbasilica. The metro/subway is a two minute walk and is the BEST way to get around the city. Bus stops are near the subway entrance. The Colosseum is about a ten minute walk and very easy to find.A free continental breakfast is provided daily, to your room, consisting of coffee, juice, milk, cereal, yogurt, biscuits, jams and spreads, chocolate filled croissants and cookies! Its a great boost of energy to get you going in the morning, I never left hungry. The owner Juliana is such a sweetheart she even prepared my breakfasts the night before (because my tours often departed very early) Also there is 24/7 complementary/self serve coffee, tea, fresh fruit, treats and pie available in reception. If you're in Rome and you're looking for a GREAT Bed and Breakfast Casa di Silvia is the way to go.","June 30, 2013","20    Casa di Silvia

1029,"This hotel was a great find in Rome which when we visited was incredibly hot. We chose the hotel because it had a pool which was a god send with the hot weather we experienced. The hotel was clean and tidy and a lovely space on the outskirts of the city centre. The bus stop into central Rome was a five minute walk away from the hotel which was very handy. The pool area was quite as polished as it looks like on the official photographs but was lovely. The pool had been cleaned and refilled on our first day and was too cold to use but heated up throughout the week. The staff were lovely and very helpful and always seemed happy to help. On a couple of occasions when we were using the pool area I came back to the room and found the keys in the door of the room. I know it was a quiet hotel and well staffed but I felt security was an issue especially as this happened twice. On both occasions I took the keys back to reception. Also I wasn’t happy that when you left the hotel you left your room key in a bowl in reception. On three or four occasions we came in, collected it and no one was about and anyone could do the same and get into your room. Apart from security for its price and level of hotel it was a good choice. ","June 29, 2019","21    Palm Gallery Hotel

1032,"This place was perfect for our family. A small boutique hotel, decorated so perfectly. It is tucked away in a quiet, beautiful section of Rome. It is away from the chaos that is the attractions and thousands of people. We would spend our days being a tourist and spend the rest of our time at Palm Gallery feeling like a resident of Rome.The room was perfect. They cleaned it promptly everyday and gave us anything that we needed. There are tons of small gardens to sit and relax, the pool deck was so tranquil and filled with plants. The hotel really had a bohemian vibe and we just loved it.At night it is lit with candles and cool light fixtures that just make it so chill and cool.The staff, so let me say we never went without a glass of wine or cappuccino in our hands. They were so gracious and accommodating. Nima and Daniel, who worked the reception area were absolutely fantastic. From telling its what to see and do, to making sure we had those drinks, to just chatting with us about our day and what we saw. They really made our trip better. Make sure to ask about the most famous gelato shop in Rome. A 20 minute walk, but it was beautiful and worth it. Another great recommendation from the staff.The breakfast, OMG...Tony and Alli provided amazing fresh food, from pancakes to omlets and croissants. We were truly spoiled.And Peggy, the resident feline.

1034,"My wife and I stayed at the Palm Gallery Hotel for our 4-night break to Rome. I researched hotels online and found the reviews of the hotel to be encouraging, so made the reservation. The hotel is small and intimate with all the staff we met being very friendly. The included breakfast was nice and the omelettes were particularly tasty. Prior to making the booking we were fully aware of the location being a bit out of the city centre, but in hindsight found this to be a bit too far for our needs, and in future we would choose a more central hotel. Unfortunately the weather was not great during our trip, so we only managed to have breakfast on the outdoor terrace on one occasion in 4 days. This was a shame as the terrace looked a lovely place to start the day. Similarly, the outdoor pool area looked nice but we did not have the opportunity to use as a result of the weather. Our terrance room number RD on the ground floor was of ample size with high ceilings was nice with a comfortable bed, but being just behind the public reception/bar areas did have minor noise issues. One thing I would recommend though is blackout blinds and the room was very light from dawn onwards. Overall a nice hotel which is exactly as described, but we unfortunately could not experience at it's best because of the weather. We would however stay closer to the city centre next time.","May 24, 2019","21    Palm Gallery Hotel

The breakfast is even better than it was in 2010 with cereal, cheese, meat, pastries, bread, caprise salad, and custom eggs (including omelettes). The coffee was great.The only issue for me was that I needed to leave the hotel very early to get to my meetings, well over an hour before they normally serve breakfast. Nevertheless, they opened up what they could for me at 6:30 and I never left hungry. On my last day at the hotel I had the full breakfast experience.The room was quiet and the heat pump was also almost silent so I was able to keep the room comfortable for sleeping.On check-in they gave me a map with all the good local restaurants and some recommendations of their favourites. I tried tow for supper and they were both great.The hotel is quite close to the major tram routes and buses. It's about a 15 minute walk to the Policlinico Metro station which will get you everywhere.I'll certainly be staying here if I get back to Rome. ","November 12, 2018","21    Palm Gallery Hotel

Far enough away from city centre to get some peace and quiet but also close enough to walk in to the town (if you don’t mind walking as it is about 30minutes). Lovely welcome from Vincenzo who took us through some handy good-to-knows, we had a welcome drink & we were also offered an upgrade if we wanted it (I actually preferred the smaller room - D1, so we opted to stay there).Mytaxi app works really well in Rome so that’s always an option if you don’t fancy waking. Free Rome Tours is fab too! Maybe don’t try I Buggeti unless you’re going to have steak) on list of recommendations - as I’m sure there would be better nearby.

There is a small pool with sunning area surrounded by plants. However it is in shade by mid afternoon. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Rome is a bustling metropolis so it is nice to be surrounded by quiet and greenery. Breakfast is good though I wasnt too keen on things in plastic bottles, containers and wrappers. The croissants were delicious. It's about a half hour walk to most attractions but you can catch the nearby metro. Recommended.","September 29, 2018","21    Palm Gallery Hotel

1059,Quiet area and really nice small garden/pool area. Great breakfast. The host Vincenzo was really nice and helpful and made us feel welcome. The reason for not giving 5 stars is the room which was a bit moist and dark (not much light) - because it was on the lower floor. Maybe different if on higher floors with more sun light. But the room was spacy and nice furnished. Overall we recommend the hotel and will consider to come back. ,"September 26, 2018","21    Palm Gallery Hotel

1061,"Stayed with my husband for a 4 day trip to Rome,the hotel looks great on the website but on arrival it looked very tired. The staff were lovely,on arrival Daniel was very welcoming and helpful,his list of local restaurants was very useful. Our room (RS) led out up to the pool which was nice but the step up was very high so not possible for less mobile people. The wooden decking up there was very loose and there was also a screw sticking up around the side of the pool. I work in Safety and I did wonder if anyone was doing any checks for things like this. I opened the wooden shutters in our room to see what the view was only to discover a dumping ground for old furniture,old tubs of food,just general mess which is not nice outside your window. The outside areas were nice but needed revarnishing and tidying up. There is a beautiful resident Cat who sadly was full of fleas, I found a flea on the bed one night. The hotel is not far from the metro but too far to walk from the Train Station,it have us a good base to see the main attractions of Rome. It has lots of potential so I gave it 3 stars mainly because the staff are so lovely but it needs some care to make it look like the website pictures.","September 16, 2018","21    Palm Gallery Hotel

It was very nicely decorated and clean with a fridge , plenty of hangers in the Wardrobe and very clean. The breakfast was fabulous , fresh eggs cooked how you wanted, between us we had omlettes, poached eggs and boiled eggs all lovely and hot. There were plenty of cereals, and fresh fruit and pastries. Yoghurts in the fridge and a choice of smoothies I had the watermelon and the detox one both very nice. The best part of our stay was the pool. It was just what we needed after 3 full days to have a rest day and just spent it in the pool was perfect. The Hotel is very near the bus stops and we used these all the time. Its just 1.50 Euros each for a bus ticket and the trip took about 10-15mins to get to the centre of town. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again in an instant.

1064,"This is a small yet super classy hotel. It's friendly staff, lovely grounds, and homey atmosphere made it a perfect base for us in Rome. We especially loved the pool- such a treat in the afternoons. I also recommend the terrazza room with access to the pool. The hotel is family friendly, has a resident cat, and the palms that give it it's name. I would recommend hot water pots in the rooms- it was annoying to have to go out at 9 only to find that there was no one to heat up water for a cup of tea or coffee. That is probably my only pressing recommendation.The breakfast is good, and generous. We had no issues going into town. Everything is a quick bus ride away: 60, 62 go straight to the city center. Also do stop at La Romana, the best Gelataria in town, which is a nice, 10 minute evening walk from the hotel. ","September 1, 2018","21    Palm Gallery Hotel

The area is not in the historic center, but it is easy to get to the historic sites with subway, trams or buses - or even on foot. Rooms are spaceous and nice, the breakfast is sufficient, omelettes can be ordered. You can choose to eat inside or outside on the nice terrace. There is even a small pool to refresh yourself on hot days. The owner and her staff? Absolutely fantastic. They will do all they can to help you and make you feel welcome. I use this hotel both for business and pleasure. Remember to go to Fontana di Trevi and toss a coin into it over your shoulder - then you are sure to return to Rome one day.

Importantly, the hotel offers family rooms to accommodate a family of 4. Every employee with whom we interacted during our stay was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good, and we loved sitting on the beautiful terrace in the mornings. We also ate a light lunch at the hotel on a couple of occasions. There is a limited menu, but the food was quite good. The pool area in the back is small but lovely with plenty of seating. We walked to a few different restaurants (including I Butteri and Bruto) close to the hotel for dinner, and also walked to a wonderful gelateria, Guttilla.

1069,We stayed here with our two children (9 and 12yrs old) for four nights in july. We had a corner room with direct access to the pool. The roome was a good size that works for kids this age or younger. The hotel is a converted villa with a lovely little pool located just minutes outside of Rome center. The owner and staff are wonderful and helpful with top service. Email communication was prompt and efficient. We arrived later than planned (after 11pm) due to flight delay but it was still no trouble for the owner to make a snack and a delicious simple pasta dish. Daniel and Vincenzo and the rest of the staff were always there to ensure everything we needed was looked after. The terrace/pool area was a great treat after a long and hot day. The bus stop to get to the center is a short and easy walk from the hotel (6 minutes maybe) and tickets for the bus can be bought on the way. There are plenty of restaurants in the area all in what we consider an easy strolling distance (10 to 20 minutes). We did take a taxi twice and believe we paid about 13 euros to get back in the evening from the Pantheon area.,"August 6, 2018","21    Palm Gallery Hotel

1070,"We visited as 2 couples for a 2 night break. This hotel is faultless in every way. From the second we arrived we were looked after from welcome tapas type food and the drinks bought to us around the pool which continued all afternoon. Both the food and drink prices for a hotel is very reasonable too. We decided to upgrade to the slightly larger rooms which were magnificent with bare stone walls and a large window overlooking the pool and terrace. We spent most of our 3 days around the pool as it was so peaceful and relaxing. Ali our waiter for our stay was exceptional going over and beyond with the service we received. I would rate this service the best I have ever received from any hotel or waiter ever. Luisa and her husband own the hotel. What beautiful people, both friendly and helpful and went out of our way to ensure our stay was amazing. We ate at a restaurant Elenora D’Arborria (which was recommended by someone who also stayed at Palm Gallery) which is a short walk around from the hotel. This restaurant is a must. The waiter suggested we have the Seafood Antipasti for starters! Wow wow wow is all I can say! The food was outstanding and the service impeccable. The hotel is probably a 10 minute taxi ride from the centre of Rome which is perfect to get out of the hustle and bustle of the town. The day we left, was my friends birthday. Luisa the owner had spent the morning baking a birthday cake. Before we left all of the staff came to the pool dining Happy Birthday with the cake complete with a candle. I have to say the cake was delicious. This hotel is amazing in every way. We can not wait to return. Luisa and Co especially Ali. Thank you so so much for making our stay special.

1071,"After reading some great reviews about this hotel I was excited to see if it could possibly live up to its reputation. And did it? YES and more. I can’t rave about this hotel enough. A short bus or metro ride away from the bustle of the city and the palm gallery brings calmness and serenity in an amazing setting. From the moment we arrived in early evening and sat on the terrace for our welcome drinks we knew we’d chosen well. The gardens are lush and you just feel that all is right with the world. Lots of helpful information and a recommendation for a quick local pizza that night. We stayed in one of the panoramic rooms as we were travelling with our two teenage children. Sleeping 4 comfortably. The rooms and indeed the decor of the whole hotel is beautiful. Beds were really comfy, as were the pillows. We had a view of the swimming pool from our room which was perfect. Breakfast is served either inside or sitting in the garden. Tranquil and a great start to the day. Breakfast is plentiful and of a high standard. Cereals, bread, meat, cheeses, fruit etc. Fresh fruit smoothies a great addition. Freshly cooked eggs, omelettes and pancakes were also really good. The staff were also brilliant. So friendly. Special mention to Vincenzo as he was so lovely to our children. All the staff were fantastic without exception. The swimming pool area was lovely. Big bean bags, comfy chairs and hammock made the whole setting a great place to chill out. After a hot, sticky day in Rome to come back to such a beautiful place and jump in the pool was just perfect. If you’re looking for a hotel in Rome, stop looking. You’ve found it.

At first we wondered if the location would be inconvenient because we usually try to stay close to a metro station. We never once found it to be a problem. Taxis were cheap, buses were easy to find and located nearby, and it was worth a little extra effort to go ""home"" to this beautiful building, garden, terrace and pool after a day of walking the city. Additionally, the hotel proactively provided a great deal of information via email prior to our arrival and during the check in process that we felt we were so well prepared to enjoy Rome. They went out of their way to make sure every question was answered and they provided a variety of recommendations (restaurants, grocery stores, etc.) so we could easily navigate the neighborhood.What makes this hotel truly stand out is the staff. From the moment Vincenzo greeted us we were so impressed with every staff person we met. Vincenzo and Daniel went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed and enjoyed our stay. Ali went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and at home. He frequently checked in to see if we needed anything and he always made time to chat with us, which made us feel like more than just a customer.

I’m sure they could charge double the price for this place and still be fully booked.Would 100% recommend and will definitely be coming back here if I get the chance!","January 27, 2019","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1085,I was on my first solo trip to Europe and this B & B was the perfect spot for my 4 days in Roma! A magical city. Marco one of the host was so sweet and the daily breakfast was fabulous! The rooms were spacious and the bathroom was huge! I loved this place and location and would stay here again. I walked everywhere from here and enjoyed the amazing sites just moments away! The Colosseo is a beautiful sight! I will be back to this wonderful spot!,"January 5, 2019","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1086,"We stayed 3 nights at La Finestra Sul Colosseo, walking to the B&B was no problem, it's 10 minutes away walking distance from the Metro and the closest stop to the Colosseum.. you literally are looking at in front of you as soon as you step out of the Metro station! Jaw dropping and amazing! We stayed in the room facing the street, the building across from our window was beautiful and traditional and if you lean a bit out of the window you can see the Colosseum in all its glory. We enjoyed the continental breakfast cart that was delivered promptly to the room every morning with delicious coffee and tea.The Room was spacious and airy, decorated with white walls, linens and curtains. The ceilings are high and arched with exposed brick, it made the room feel massive and traditional... very cool. The bathroom is huge with a large window and fogged glass for privacy, comfortable vanity, standup shower, toilet and bidet... very pretty! Most improtantly my 6'3"" tall fiancé was able to fit comfortably in the spacious queen size bed :). On arrival we kept in touch with Aldo via text, email and WhatsApp, he was in constant communication with us and was very helpful making sure we found our way to the B&B. The Building is secure and has a functioning elevator. The neighborhood felt very safe, we walked everywhere day and night. Ancient Rome is right outside of the doorsteps, the location is amazing! We loved walking to all of the sights. We are heavy sleepers and loved having breakfast in front of the open window so the street Rome was our preference, for light sleepers the B&B also has room facing away from the street. Overall, would highly recommend this lovely B&B and would stay here again :)","November 7, 2018","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

On the one day we went to the Vatican (a little further than most sights) we hired bikes from a place just 50 yards from the front door. Marco and Jason were excellent hosts providing a fantastic breakfast delivered to the room each morning and happy to offer advice on where to eat and where to go.

That was appreciable.Breakfast is served in room and was again very very high quality.Room / Bathroom / Bed were very good.Marco, thank you for recommending places and restaurants which certainly helped us tremendously.Made our Rome stay memorable and yes... again miss that coffee ..Wish you the best...","August 1, 2018","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1095,"The location made this the perfect place for us. Being able to walk most places and with a local metro station to take a us to the Vatican when needed was great. We were able to stroll around in the evenings and found some lovely restaurants to eat at. The room was clean, tidy and very spacious. We were in room 5, we had no views but that did not bother us. Upstairs clearly have a very energetic child who could be heard running around but by the time we were back to bed at night that was not a problem. Breakfast was amazing, a great selection, it was the perfect way to start the day. The hosts were great, we had asked prior to our arrival if we could leave our bags at the b&b after checkout as we had a later flight which they allowed us to do. They also booked taxis for us from the airport and back to it when we left. It made our trip seamless and ensured we had nothing to worry about. They also provided us with a handy map with info on the location of the sights, great neighborhoods for restaurants and stations for the metro and stops for the buses.","April 11, 2018","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1096,"This B&B is not in the heart of it all, which is fantastic. It is quiet at night (although the child that lives upstairs could use some sleeping pills), and a short walk to the colosseum. We were in suite 4 which did not have a view of the colosseum, so if you are concerned about that, suite 4 is not for you. I didn’t care, the bed and the bathroom is all I care about...you step out the door and there’s the colosseum! Speaking of, the location is nice because it is a very easy to remember walk into the heart of Rome. You walk Via Labicana until it turns into Via Fort Imperiali at the colosseum, and it seems every street eventually hits Imperiali. You can get to Trastevere easily, although I recommend a taxi or public transport (nearby) for Vatican City. It was 16 euro for a taxi from Ponte Sant Angelo to the B&B (sore feet).The breakfast was excellent, pastries, fruit, meat and cheese, juice and cappuccino. It was great to have it in our room as we planned our day. The bed was cozy, and the bathrooms are HUGE. Only issue with a bathroom that size is the echo!!!Also, don’t think you can walk from the train station to the B&B unless you’re backpacking. You’ll hate it. I did. I thought, looking at the map, it could be done. I was wrong. A taxi is less than 10 euro, just get one.","November 5, 2017","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1097,This B&B is amazing and the pictures don't do it any justice. The room is much larger than the pictures show and the bathroom is enormous. Everything is beautifully decorated and super clean. They have a small kitchen where they prepare breakfast and bring it to your room in a cart - just like heaving breakfast in bed. It is located within walking distance from the coliseum and Roman forum but away from the touristy areas. Would definitely recommend it! ,"August 3, 2017","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1098,My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights and it was easily the best place we had stayed for our whole trip. The room was immaculate and peaceful with a very comfortable bed. Breakfast in bed was amazing! I was not expecting it to be such an affair arriving on a trolley and helped us to really relax during our stay. The hosts were very kind and helpful with everything we needed - providing plenty of very good restaurant recommendations. There are only 3 rooms so it is very quiet and private. It is walkable to everywhere - we only used public transport to get to the vatican.

1099,"350+ reviews have given this b&b nearly fivestar ratings. It is #16 on TA among all of Rome B&B's. I find this utterly confounding. We reserved ""suite2"" direct from their website. So please note that this was not a bargain basement economy room reservation. This is relevant because the place is called 'window on Colosseo'. Our window opened into the bldg's courtyard and even in broad daylight all lights had to be on. We couldn't tell if it was day or night. It was like twilight zone. So that's the first - that misrepresentation. Forget Colosseo. We had no view of the outside world, period.Next, positives:- modern, updated interior- large bathroom (was important for me)- unique barrel ceilingThe rest of my comments are not necessarily things I want to categorize as 'negative'. I leave it to the reader to decide that. For us these things were not ideal. - The building foyer & staircase smelled of urine. - the room appeared clean due to the colors of floor tile etc but my shower sandals revealed otherwise everyday as the water made all the grime stream out from them. - mold all over the walls of the bathroom. - accidentally I got a whiff of the mattress. It smelled so bad! The rest of the time I was cursing myself cause you cannot ..unsmell..that! Yuck. What were we sleeping on? - the whole system for the trolley breakfast is funny at best and dysfunctional at worst. Forget the stale pastries. The fact that there is no place to have/serve breakfast makes it clear that this apartment is not set up right to sell itself as a b&b.- the location is good if you like looking at the Colosseum from standing in front of the building..it is in fact visible at the end of the road. But that is deceptive when it comes to actual walking distance. I would rather prefer a place closer to a metro stop. The trams c3 & c8 run along the street. Bus 85, 87 and the circulator line also stop near by. But we ended up having to walk to most places because Colosseo was not our main priority this time. Manzoni stop is the next best alternative. Not a short walk though. Esp after a full day of walking.- there is no onsite staff. This is just a side business for a couple of locals. Most reviews refer to 'staff'... What staff? Jason who comes in to set up the breakfast trolley for two rooms from 8-10 am? That's a strange assignment anyway.- there is a room that has the tea coffee maker but it is locked except for breakfast hours and only for admin use.- they do not own a credit card machine which is fine but in 2017 they don't use square or similar to process payment. I'm still somewhat stumped by this place. I don't know what it is or why it is ranked #16 on TA. Why such low expectations? Is it now a privilege.. being allowed to pay people for a room? I don't understand. Is a free bottle of wine the clincher? It is important to remember that in Italy coop wine is at times cheaper than restaurant water. So I hope this review helps someone with the facts presented to make an informed choice. I felt let down by the 350 rave reviews.","June 5, 2017","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1100,"A short walk from the Colosseum metro, only a matter of a few minutes, found us at the door of this place. The external surroundings and hall were a little rustic. We were met at the door by our host, who,like the others we met, were fantastic. Our room was beautiful, clean bright and spacious with high terracotta coloured brick ceilings, and the welcome bottle of wine, water and fruit in our room was much appreciated. Our host spoke excellent English and gave us lots of useful tips about where to go, how to get there, and good restaurants to try (we tried a few of his recommendations and they were really good).Breakfast was served daily at a time to suit us and set us up perfectly for each of the five days of our stay. The room was cleaned and the bed changed daily. Bottles of water are left in the room each day.Little touches by our host in checking that we had all we needed each day, and coming to say goodbye on our last day added to the quality of the experience. All the information they have us was perfectly accurate.There is something magical in stepping out on to a busy Rome road each morning and seeing the mighty Colosseum only a few hundred meters away.After we checked out we found that there was a transport strike affecting trains, the metro and some taxis. We were understandably concerned that we may not get to the airport on time. We needn't have worried. I rang our hosts to ask their advice and they arranged a taxi to take us to the airport (taxi fixed price Rome to Fumincino airport is 48 euro). The taxi arrived bang on time and the driver was very polite.The whole experience was excellent and one which I would recommend to anyone wanting to explore this beautiful city and prepared to swap the trappings of expensive hotels for a beautiful room on the doorstep of one of the wonders of the world, coupled with a high quality personal service delivered by wonderful polite people who go the extra mile.

1102,"We were looking for accomodation close to the marathon starting/finishing area. Perfect.Suite-1 was a quiet room (no traffic or other noise) with comfortable mattress and pillows. Bathroom was spacious and the extensive hot shower (lying, sitting, standing) after the run made me walking through Rome´s touristic spots the same afternoon again.Staff was friendly and helpful offering water, juice and fruits on arrival. Located between access to both metro lines A and B and close to some bus lines.Offered private taxi service from airport worked well, so it took us just half an our to arrive.Certainly, some improvements would be possible: A mirror in the bedroom, a shaving mirror in the bathroom, a dish for shower gels,...Accomodation is in a residential building with an inner courtyard, a good old-fashioned elevator giving all of it a kind of Italian flair, thus better than many anonymous modern standard hotels made of glass and concrete.

1115,"Prompt and useful communication from Aldo before our arrival meant our arrival was simple by the Leonardo Train (14E each single journey) then two stops on either Metro line gets you within about 500m of the B&B. Doesn't look much from the outside, it's within a typical continental block of apartments but inside our room and bathroom was spotlessly clean and both were also spacious. The buildings channel up the road noise, which isn't that busy, so we shut the windows at night but the air conditioning meant any temperature isn't a problem. We had a double view of the Colosseum if you poke your head out of the bedroom and bathroom windows, it is at the end of the road and made for an impressive walk home after eating out in the evening. We were met by Marco who was very helpful and informative and gave us the best tips on where to eat (he's right!) he brought us our breakfast of toast, fruit, yoghurt, ham and cheese and pastries in the mornings. Nothing was too much trouble.The accommodation is in walking distance of the sites if you don't mind walking and is situated between the two Metro lines within a 5/10 minute walk if you do. You can get to the landmarks easily using this and it's only 7E for a day Metro pass.Fantastic value for money, hotel standard for a fraction of the price. Wouldn't hesitate to go back or to recommend this accommodation.","April 5, 2016","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1116,"Everything that has been said before is true. I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone especially if you like to be independent.The location is fantastic but so are the buses that serve Via Labicana, making it extremely easy to arrive at Termini (85) but also very easy to get about the city to visit all the Rome 'must sees'.It is also very easy to walk to a number of restaurants in nearby monti and also closer.Do not miss the church of St Clemente as it is also nearby.I also have to say that the staff at La Finestra were extremely helpful","April 5, 2016","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1117,"We had some difficulty getting to it as we were held up at Rome Airport, but as we drove up Via Labicana there was Aldo waiting to greet us and help with the luggage, having waited for an hour. We found the room everything we could have wished, spacious enough for a couch, a desk and a large double bed. Continental breakfast was brought in on a dumb waiter each morning and set us up for a great days of walking around Rome. everything was clean and well laid out - I recommend it for anyone. As the entrance is on a main road that is well lit it is quite secure as the outer and inner doors are both locked and you have both keys. There is a great ice cream/coffee/cake shop about 150 metres down the road towards the Colosseum.","March 3, 2016","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1120,"We stayed here in November 2014. This is an unusual place in a number of respects. The room and bathroom are really nice and while it is in the historic center it is in a rough looking apartment building and at quite a walking distance to subway stops and places of interest other than the colosseo. The young entreprenuer couple running the B&B are said by most to be exremely pleasant and supportive. Perhaps because we ran afoul of some of their rules ( e.g. left the external door to the apartment unlocked in error one night in over a week's stay, late to breakfast), our experience was not so friendly. My wife left her cell phone in a cab as we exited it in a part of Rome unfamiliar to us. She called the owner to get help to call the cell number and instruct the cab driver where to meet us. He told her to call the police and to forget the cell phone as Rome was not like the U.S. We called the cell phone number and luckily the cab driver answered. In very limited Italian I was able to tell him where to come to return the cell phone. This was not an easy transaction as he spoke no English and my Italian is terrible but with a lot of good will on the cab drivers part, we were successful and I tipped him well. In sum, the room was large, well decorated and comfortable with an excellent price. The location was not near anything of much interest to us and it was a long walk to the subway. Cabs were quite difficult to hail unless you walked a distance as well. This is basically a small apartment with no services available on site except for a two hour window for breakfast in the morning or if you call the owner. Otherwise you are largely on your own. If you are a great walker and don't make many errors or require assistance, this may well be a great value for you as it apparently is for most people..","October 18, 2015","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1121,"This B&B is awesome! It is a 10 minute walk from the metro station at the Colosseum and is in a quiet area with great restaurants nearby. It is a very small entrance into what seems to be an apartment building, and once you are inside the B&B you are so thankful for the wonderful air conditioning. We were in contact with Aldo before arriving and then taken care of by Marco during our stay. They were both incredible hosts. Marco gave us some great suggestions for dinner, especially some good local spots that were not touristy at all! In terms of the room, the bed was really comfortable, the AC worked great (it was July and it was HOT), it was very clean, and it had great decor. The breakfast each morning is brought over to you and you can have breakfast in bed, which my wife was obsessed with. It comes with a fun assortment of pastries, juices, fruit, and coffee. It was delicious!Overall, we loved our stay at this B&B. We loved the cozy room, the quiet location, and the yummy breakfast.

1122,"The B&B was perfect - it exceeded our expectations in every way. The room was spacious, exceptionally clean and extraordinarily comfortable - especially after a long day in the Roman heat! The location was great too. A wonderful breakfast was served each morning - wheeled right into your room at your convenience. Marco did an incredible job showing us places of interest and recommending restaurants that were traditional and reasonably priced. Each of his recommendations was 100% correct! Rome was our last stop on an 11 day Italian trip and we truly had some of the best food of the trip while in Rome. I would recommend this B&B without any hesitation whatsoever and my wife and I will definitely stay there again if we are lucky enough to return to Rome!.","August 11, 2015","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1123,"Rome was our final destination in our 3 week tour of Europe (London, Paris, Milan, Lake Como, Cinque Terre, Florence, Rome). We were tired of packing/unpacking, public transportation, small rooms and after almost 3 weeks we were ready to head back to Southern California . . . but we had one more stop (wife asked if we could skip Rome and go home) to make Rome. We were pleasantly surprised at how huge our room was!! The high ceilings added to the grandness of the unit (Room 1, the Colosseum view). Highlights: service was over-the-top. Aldo stayed in touch with us through email. Marco met us out front, provided neighborhood information and brought breakfast into our room. Aldo's father even pitched in on our final morning by preparing breakfast for us. Our flight out of Rome was not until later in the evening and we had asked if they can keep our luggage until our departure. They initially agreed and then, surprise . . . they did even better and allowed us to checkout later in the day so we could even shower before we took the shuttle (Terravision out of Termini to FCO). La Finestra is about a 10 minute walk to the Metro stops or 3 minute walk to the bus stop (recommend the buses since you can access all of Rome easily). Extremely helpful, spacious accommodation (Room 1), close to public transportation, and did I mention all of this at a very competitive rate. I am looking forward to staying at La Fienstra again, next time I'm in Rome. Thank you Aldo and family, for a wonderful end to our memorable European vacation.","July 3, 2015","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1124,"I have stayed in Rome on many occasions and this b&b was by far the best value for money place that I have been to. I have stayed in hotels and apartments in ever district of the city and this has been the best. Only 5 minutes walk from the Coloseum, the apartment was very quiet very clean and tidy and tastefully decorated (and the air con was excellent). Breakfast was served on a tray in your room and was very good quality. There was an abundance of restaurants within easy walking distance and if you wanted to go further afield the taxi rank at the Coloseum was available and 10 euros took you just about anywhere in the city. I highly recommend this place, check it out.","May 19, 2015","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1125,"This bnb is a lovely unique tranquil haven only 5 minutes from the metro and the colleseum. The rooms are spacious, and light and although on a main road no disturbance from the outside traffic. The breakfast is so cute, wheeled to your room less than a five mins from telling aldo your ready and The coffee was great just what you need to set you up for a day of walking around the sites. lots of nice places to eat within 5minutes from the bnb, but if your not sure aldo has many recommendations. 2 out of the 3days we stayed it poured it down which was such a shame especially as there is so much walking involved. (don't ever worry about packing an umbrella the minute it rains on every road is a man selling one for cheap or selfie sticks! ) one tip if you are visiting the sites especially the Vatican the ques are ridiculously long, like over 3hours and in the rain wouldn't be much fun so pay a bit extra to skip the que otherwise you will waste most of your visit waiting to get in. We had the Vatican/omna card which was good to skip the lines but I didnt realise the nearest office to the bnb was closed at the weekends so we had to go to the St Peters square office and there was a que to collect the card so make sure you go early. There is so much to see and you certainly will need a second visit. For me the St Peters is just incredible but also go see the a amazing ceilings in St John lateran the cathedral church of rome not far from the bnb. It is the oldest church in the west. rome is so fantastic and your trip wouldn't be complete unless you stay at la finestra or unless you get proposed to under the arch of Constantine during your evening stroll!

1128,"This small B&B is a wonderful place to stay in Rome: Near to many attractions, restaurants, wine bars etc. And, the real gem is the owner/host Gioia. From the moment she greeted us upon arrival to our departure, she was friendly, gracious and a veritable font of useful information. We were provided with maps, recommendations and handy tips. The B&B is situated in an apartment building with a small elevator. We stayed in one of the two suites on the second floor. There are 3 more on the fourth floor. Our room (Room 4) was a decent size with a large bathroom. We had no view of the Colosseum as our room faced into the courtyard. We were not bothered by the noises from the apartment above where a family with children live. But, if you are sensitive to children's crying and running about, ask for another room. An ample breakfast is wheeled into the room on a trolley in the morning when you request it. As other reviewers have noted, there is no onsite staff from about lunchtime until 8-ish in the morning. However, the owners are accessible by phone at any time. This is, after all, a B&B not a hotel. We were delighted with our experience and would not hesitate to return here if our travels again bring us to Rome.","December 21, 2014","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1129,"We already knew we wanted to stay here but it was only available on 2 of the 4 nights we were in Rome so we picked a nearby hotel on our first 2 nights and concluded our stay at this lovely B&B. So glad we did, our room at the Mercure a few steps away paled in comparison to our suite here!The building looks a bit old and outdated but didn't bother us. From the entrance, we were buzzed in. We took the lift from the left side of the hallway; it’s tiny but can fit two people and 2 medium-sized luggage. We were greeted by Gioia and were given a map and recommendations on where to go and restaurants to try. We had Room #1 (Colosseo view Suite) and it was gorgeous... the most spacious room we’ve had in our entire stay in Europe. The ceiling was in a concave shape with bricks tiled over it (how do they keep this so clean?), the bed was immaculate and the windows did a great job keeping out any noise from the street. We went in early October and the sun was still out like a maniac so the air conditioning was appreciated. The room doesn’t have a mini bar but it has a wine chiller. The bathroom is spacious with a heater. The only thing is whenever you turn on the faucet there’s a big mechanical sound that vibrates and resonates from the walls- probably a water pump. Didn’t bother us but was wondering if the noise reached our neighboring rooms (I’m sure if you email about it they’ll be able to clarify). The foyer has a couch and some magazines, books and travel pocket books in case you need it. WiFi was fantastic. Never saw or ran into another guest and we always had the elevator to ourselves, so we felt like we had our own private flat in Rome.On our first morning, we were so hungry (our body clocks still stuck in local time) so I knocked on the door and asked if we could have breakfast. I didn’t realize I had asked for it too early (I think breakfast was supposed to be served around 730 or 8AM and it was only 7AM), but Aldo’s dad was kind enough to serve it within 5mins of asking for it! Breakfast was ample- your choice of coffee, some fruit juice, a few slices of ham, a little bit of cheese, yogurt, fruits, two croissants, some toast and a sweet pastry. No phones in the rooms but you can just just knock on the pantry door to ask for your breakfast to be wheeled in. There’s a small restaurant right next to the main building door (forgot the name but they have a “P” sign) that we frequented- lovely people…loved their Pizza and Panini, we must have eaten there at least 4 times in our entire night stay in Rome. There’s plenty of convenience stores nearby so you can grab a bottled water to take with you to the room. Didn’t see any Tabaci stores nearby when we were there so we’d buy BIT tickets in the nearest subway station or the many tobacconists near the Coliseum (there are plenty in Via Cavour).Upon check-out, we asked for help in calling a taxi and were even given a small discount on the rooms (thanks, Aldo!) Our taxi arrived a few mins early in front of the building and we arrived at Roma Termini in about 10 minutes (it was a Sunday) and paid about EU15 (which was a good deal to us because we didn’t want to have to lug our stuff around all the way to Manzoni station- it’s easy to get there, but maybe not with medium luggage). Colosseo station seemed too busy for us so we always took Manzoni Station to get around. BTW the elevator can only be accessed if you’re coming into Manzoni, but if you arrive at the station, you will have to carry your luggage up two flights of stairs to get to the exit near Via Labicana- so better to pack lightly, or take a taxi if you want to save time and effort. This shouldn't discourage you from booking though, It's a great place with some of the nicest people managing it. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.","November 11, 2014","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

Aldo was very helpful in replying to our emails and getting us booked in and helping us with any queries regarding getting there. He gave us and full guide in getting there using public transport however we opted for a taxi as we had never been to Italy before and we're unfamiliar with the public transport. When we arrived at the place it did look a little run down from the outside however the rooms are absolutely perfect! We stayed in room 4. It has pristine white decor, an absolutely amazing bathroom and the comfiest bed I have ever slept in!

1131,"We booked La Finestra Sul Colesseo after reading all the great reviews on here. On arrival we found the entrance a little worrying, the b&b is part of a rustic Italian apartment block. The entrance is quite dark and often smells quite unpleasant. On arriving at the b&b entrance however you would be shocked to think such a beautifully decorated space can be found in this block.Guido sat us down offered us drinks and thoroughly went through a map of Rome and the best places to eat and drink and of course sight see! This was fantastic and really helped us find our way around. The room was lovely, bright airy and a great (sideways) view of the Colesseum. The bed was so comfortable and lovely to come back to after a long day walking around Rome (you really can walk everywhere!) The location of the b&b is ideal and you are never far from anything.Sadly there were a couple of issues we found. The first being breakfast. From what we understood breakfast would be served to your room between 8-10am. What wasn’t made clear was that you had to go to the kitchen to ask for your breakfast 5 minutes before you wanted it delivered. This was rather annoying and on our first morning we waited 1.5 hours before eventually going to ask when we could expect breakfast (very annoying!) It’s also a shame that the kitchen area is not accessible during the day- it would be nice to have access to tea and coffee making facilities. Another small gripe we had was the lack of English TV channels. Granted you don’t go on holiday to watch television, however after a long day it’s always nice to go back to your room rest, shower and chill before heading out for dinner. During this time it would have been nice to watch some English news but the only channel which was in English was MTV. Overall we enjoyed our trip to rome and found this b&b comfortable and convenient. I believe a couple of modifications would make this b&b even more inviting in particular a re-vamp of the communal areas","October 22, 2014","22    La Finestra sul Colosseo B&B

1132,"We stayed here with friends. I must say we were concerned by the appearance of the building & the strange smell when we first entered the premises but were happily relieved when Aldo escorted us up by elevator and showed us to our units. What makes this B&B exceptional are the beautifully appointed, clean, spacious, tastefully decorated rooms, and bathrooms, only a 15 minute walk from the train station, and of course a stone throw away from the coliseum, all this and a view, for a pretty fair price, considering this is Rome. The breakfasts are basic continental style, and vary little from one day to the next, served on a rolling tray to the bedroom as there's no dining area. Access to the kitchen amenities is not allowed, but there's a wine fridge in the bedroom (suite) and we were treated to a complimentary wine bottle to celebrate our arrival.

We wanted to relax and revisit some favorite spots and restaurants in Trastevere and Rome. The hotel is well located for walking trips to several attractions in Rome and those within Trastevere. Rooms are clean with housekeeping every day; and a very good breakfast selection. There is a courtyard area and an inside area for breakfast. There is a small stocked fridge in the room with items for purchase. One of the best amenities was a free smart phone for your use. Free local and international calls and Google maps. It was very handy for navigatiing the area. The lift to the second floor is small. Fits 2 or three people max. We had a room with a Lanai which was a nice place to relax between walking excursions. We would have used it more if it hadn’t been so hot. Everything is very clean and well maintained. Staff is very friendly and helpful. There is an ATM available on the opposite side of the block. The tram is a short walk if you need it. The hotel is a short cab ride from Termini station about 15 euros.

1140,We have now stayed at this fabulous hotel four times this year. One of the times my daughter was traveling alone and I was confident that the front desk would always keep an eye on her. It is a charming hotel we love the Limone Room. The breakfast is wonderful and the chef is magnificant. We enjoyed sitting in the courtyard in the early evening before walking a quick stroll to Trastevere for dinner. Wonderful restaurants are very nearby. The warmth and charm of the Italian people are alive and well at Relais Le Clarisse!! ,"May 2, 2019","23    Relais Le Clarisse in Trastevere

This place is a great location for a lot of good restaurants and is only a short walk or taxi ride to other attractions. The room was very comfortable, although very noisy since it faced the street. (Note to self: ask for a room away from the street next time.)All the employees were super friendly and nice. In particular, Romina prepared the breakfasts, including her home-made cakes. Breakfast is not to be missed because she does a great job.Would definitely stay here again.","April 7, 2019","23    Relais Le Clarisse in Trastevere

We were on the ground floor overlooking a lovely courtyard where it would have been possible to have breakfast if it had been a little warmer. Very nice staff all speaking good English. Maybe the breakfast could be a little better. Fresh Coffee rather than a machine and a rather poor selection of warm dishes.

The room was comfortable and charming, the hydro bathtub was a nice treat after a day walking around Rome and the mix of old and new throughout the hotel was thoughfully and tastefully done.Breakfast was the usual continental self-serve approach with cold meats and cheeses, bread rolls, yoghurts, fresh fruit, juices and excellent coffee (obviously!). All good quality and as much as you might like.The location was second to none: from a quiet side street it is a short stroll to all the night-life, restaurants and bars in Trastevere, and a pleasant meander along the Tiber will take you into the Jewish Quarter and Piazza del Venezia, the Colosseum and the Forum and the Pantheon.","March 5, 2019","23    Relais Le Clarisse in Trastevere

1147,"Stayed here for 4 nights. We chose this hotel as it looked charming and we wanted to stay in Trastevere. Unfortunately, we ended up feeling disappointed and let down.Firstly, the positive points. The staff were, for the most part, friendly and helpful. The rooms were charmingly old fashioned and clean. The breakfast was fine, but not outstanding, and the hotel location was perfect.Now, the negative points. The WiFi signal wasn’t great. Sometimes it was fine, other times there was no connection. There were no channels on the tv.The pillows were quite hard, as was the mattress. The bathroom was fine, but a bit on the small side. There is only 1 lift in the hotel, and it’s tiny and extremely slow. There were two corridors on the upper floor of the hotel. You have to walk through the first corridor in order to get to the second corridor, which is where the rooms are situated. The lights in the first corridor were never turned on in the evening, which meant that we had to walk in complete darkness until we reached the second corridor, which had motion activated lights.Lastly, we were extremely unhappy with the way that the lady who was managing the breakfast treated us on the day that we were checking out. Breakfast begins at 7:30 am. We checked out at 7:15. We asked if it would be possible to have a quick breakfast. The lady at the front desk told us to go down to the breakfast area to see whether it was ready. She also said that we would at least be able to have a coffee, as it’s from a machine. My wife went down while I was busy checking out. She was told that we could not have breakfast or coffee, and that we would have to wait, even though the food had already been put out and was ready. Unfortunately, we couldn’t wait as we had to take a taxi to the airport. If we were checking out an hour before breakfast, of course we would understand. But 15 minutes before breakfast, and with the food already prepared, we didn’t see a reason to refuse us. They need to understand that sometimes people have to leave a bit early to catch a flight. This is not how paying guests should be treated and it left a bad taste in our mouths. After that experience, I can’t recommend this hotel to anybody.","March 4, 2019","23    Relais Le Clarisse in Trastevere

The location is convenient for anyone prepared to walk a km or so to tourist destinations on the other side of the Tiber — or take a bus or tram (no nearby metro stop). There is also a taxi stand only a block away. Highly recommended as a comfortable and surprisingly secluded place to stay in Trastevere. ","November 14, 2018","23    Relais Le Clarisse in Trastevere

The following day the hotel arranged a taxi to collect us and take us to our booked hotel, and couldn't have been more helpful.

1155,"We stayed with 2 children aged 9 and 10 in a Family suite room overlooking the courtyard.We were fortunate to get a free early checkin (around 10.30am) and were very happy with our room. The room was huge, very clean and featured a sofa bed (double) , a trundle bed, and a king size bed. There was a jetted spa within the shower area which the kids were very happy with and plenty of space to unwind. Our daughter enjoyed playing in the courtyard area which was like an extension of our room. There are a couple of steps up to the room but the kind gentleman who checked us in helped with carrying it up.we checked out early around 7am so missed breakfast which is served from 7.30am. The hotel kindly offered to make us takeout breakfast but we just popped around to the pastesserie one minute walk away to get a coffee.The hotel is well positioned to explore Trastevere and there are large numbers of restaurants/ Cafe in the area to enjoy. The Wifi is excellent and we experienced no lagging. There is a supermarket one minute walk away which does pre-prepared food like chicken, potatoes, salads etc. There is also anOVS store which is my daughters favourite clothing brand in ItalyI would recommend the area to stay, having visited Rome three times we found it a nice, chilled area.the staff at the hotel were very friendly and accommodating, they speak excellent English. The only issue we had was with the driver that transported us from the hotel to the airport. He was constantly texting / talking/ holding his phone. The hotel had organised the transfer for us and whilst not in their direct control it is something to be wary of. It maybe considered usual for Italians to do this but to our family it was a safety concern.

1159,"We have just returned from a 3 night break in Rome where we stayed at the Relais Le Clarisse and I would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel.As others have said, it's an oasis of calm and it was lovely to return here after a busy day in the city. We chose a superior room with a view of the courtyard. Our bed was very comfortable and we were delighted at how quiet our room was. If we hadn't seen other guests at breakfast we would have believed that we were the only people staying there. The bathroom was clean and the shower was excellent, plenty of hot water and good water pressure.The reception staff were very friendly, polite and helpful. We arrived an hour before check in so they stored our bags while we went for some lunch.The breakfast buffet was great with lots of choice - coffee, juice, yoghurt, fruit, bread, pastries, cakes, cheese and cold meats. There was some hot food, although not a great deal, but this didn't bother us. All we wanted was something quick and tasty, and this was exactly what we got. And eating breakfast sat outside our room in the courtyard was a bonus.The real selling point though was the location which was perfect for us. The only time we used public transport was to transfer between the airport and the hotel (FR1 train then number 8 tram which stops almost outside the hotel). We walked everywhere else including the Colleseum, Forum, Vatican, Spanish Steps, Pantheon and Trevi Fountain. What we particularly liked about the location was that in the evening we were right in the heart of Trastevere which is full of bars and restaurants. The atmosphere was amazing, there were locals and tourists of all ages so there was a real buzz and we spent all 3 evenings in Trastevere. Also, even though it was very busy in the small squares, it felt completely safe.The only point to be aware of is that access to the rooms above ground level is via a small (but modern) lift not via stairs so if you don't like lifts then I would recommend requesting one of the ground floor rooms.","September 4, 2018","23    Relais Le Clarisse in Trastevere

I was so looking forward to our stay based on the reviews I had read. We were very disappointed. The first room the desk clerk took us to was already occupied by someone else. The second room was tiny (hardly any room for our luggage) and smelled very musty. When I discovered water all over the bathroom floor, I insisted they move us. After charging us more, they moved us into a larger room. The linens looked very old, and we still had the same musty smell. I didn't feel that the room was very clean. The breakfast room is very odd as you enter from the courtyard (which was also a disappointment) down a steep set of stairs to a basement like room. Choices for breakfast were also disappointing.

I'd never been to rome, and wasn't sure what the situation would be like, so after making the reservation, I emailed the hotel to say that I was getting in late, to which they replied that would be no problem and to call them when I arrived.I got to rome in the early evening. I hadn't slept for about 30 hours. after a long taxi ride in which the driver took a very circuitous route to my hotel, he dropped me off at around 9:30pm in front of a huge gray building on a back street, and I couldn't find the name of the hotel anywhere. it was dark, cold, and raining, I had all my luggage but not an umbrella, and my phone battery was in the single digits. some residents of the building came along and pointed to one of about 30 buttons on the wall to indicate that the b&b was located in the building. I buzzed the buzzer, but there was no answer. the residents let me in and I took the elevator to the floor where the hotel was supposed to be. there was no one around and no one answered the door. I called and emailed, but again, no answer, and nowhere to charge my phone.exhausted and not wanting to wander around in the dark rainy night in a city I didn't know at all, I considered laying down in the hallway to try to get some rest. but I decided to keep going, and walked back outside until I found a fitness center that was open. the person behind the desk tried to call another hotel for me, but they didn't answer, so she let me sit in the lobby and charge my phone. I got out my lonely planet guide and decided to try a few other hotels in the neighborhood. after no answer to a few others, someone answered at Relais Le Clarisse a Trastevere Roma. she spoke English (!) and told me that they had a room, and that she would be at the desk for a few more hours, gave me the number for a taxi company, and told me to call back if I had any problems with the taxi company.the taxi company did not answer, so I walked the mile to the hotel in the rain. when I arrived, the person with whom I had spoken was waiting and had prepared the room for me. the room turned out to perfect, with a huge comfortable bed, beautiful furnishings, and a private separate entrance. the hotel has a lovely garden patio, excellent location, and is not terribly expensive. I was so overjoyed that I decided to go out at midnight for pizza and wine, so she pointed me in the direction of a lively nearby piazza.heartfelt thanks to Relais Le Clarisse a Trastevere Roma for this amazing welcome to an incredible city.","April 17, 2018","23    Relais Le Clarisse in Trastevere

1170,"I cant give 5 stars, because the parking situation is terrible, and that’s important to us in a room selection. If you are not driving, and in need of a convenient parking space, this is a great hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in the middle of Trastevere, so you can walk to a lot of good places to eat and shop. You can also walk from the hotel to the Coleseum, although its a pretty good walk. The room itself is large and comfortable, which is hard to find in Europe. Our room was a suite which had a den with a table, couch TV and refrigerator that is separate from the bedroom. Also had a kitchen if you want it for an extra fee. We declined the kitchen as a big part of visiting Europe for us is to experience the great food and fun restaurants, which there are many near the hotel.

1171,"Enjoyed my 2 night stay here very much. Room and bed very comfortable, very quiet, everything worked, very good shower, kettle in room, good breakfast, staff extremely pleasant and helpful. My room was off the courtyard which was great (although ashtrays on the tables suggest it may not be so quiet and pleasant at warmer times of year). Once we worked out the buses and trams we found this hotel very well located for getting around, but close enough to most major sites to walk to, and found some good restaurants and bars nearby. Would happily return!","March 1, 2018","23    Relais Le Clarisse in Trastevere

1172,"Really enjoyed our stay! The staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable.The hotel is located right on a Main Street which makes it easy to walk to most of the popular locations in Rome or take a quick tram ride which stops very close by. Being so close to the street caused a lot of street noise if you need to keep the windows open.Walls are pretty thin so you can hear what’s going on in the hall. Luckily our room had no adjacent rooms. Breakfast was simple but a few delicious dishes were made in-house by the staff. What we appreciated most as Americans is that they did serve eggs! The staff even let us go in early one morning when we had to be up before breakfast started. The hotel offers a car service to the airport, but we found that Uber would actually be cheaper and more convenient. The driver we were given was also not the best, and was really upset that our flight was delayed 2 hours which was out of our control. This has nothing to do with the actual hotel as I’m sure this is a separate organization. Overall we found that the staff was there for whatever we needed. The location was safe and convenient. Would definitely stay here again on a return to Rome. ","February 15, 2018","23    Relais Le Clarisse in Trastevere

1173,"I have mixed feelings about this hotel. Basically, our stay was fine and the staff could not be better, but I could not get a good night's sleep here and I will probably stay somewhere else the next time I am in Trastevere. I think that when I booked the hotel I did not pay enough attention to the star rating of the hotel (my fault) so my expectations were a little too high.The location is excellent and the front desk staff could not have been better. The housekeeper and the staff in the breakfast room were great, too.Our room was off the garden -- if you are a light sleeper, ask for a room in a different location. I was repeatedly awoken by other guests talking and laughing as they walked across the garden to the lobby, suitcases being dragged across the garden and in the hall and rooms above us, and I could hear it every time the elevator went up or down. I could hear the guests above us coughing and talking. We ended up running the HVAC fan just for the white noise. One night I was awoken by a couple sitting talking and smoking at the table right outside our door. I think this would be even worse in warmer weather.This is not a 4 or 5 star hotel, so make sure you know what to expect. Toiletries are minimal and there are no slippers, no Kleenex, no washcloths. The water temperature in the shower fluctuated between too hot and too cold. If you have mobility issues, ask if there are steps inside your room -- we had 3 big steps between the bedroom and the bathroom and a small step within the bathroom between the shower and the bathtub. The bed was OK -- the mattress was nice and firm but it sloped towards the middle. The pillows were of the shredded foam variety. Our room had an old-fashioned lock with a real key that was very big to carry around. The lighting in the room was awful. There was only one place in the room where it was bright enough to comfortably sit and read. On the other side of the room, I had to use the flashlight on my phone to operate the safe. There was no light and no outlet by the desk, so it wasn't of much use.The breakfast buffet was probably a little below average for Rome (decent cold selection but no hot choices). However, it's served in a very small room with the tables very close together. This wasn't a problem in January, but in summer when the hotel is probably full I think it would be quite uncomfortable because you wouldn't be able to walk between the tables without asking someone else to get up and move their chair. Also, if you have any mobility or balance issues or are of a certain age, getting to the breakfast room could be dangerous for you. You have to go down a step or two, open a door, and then continue down a set of narrow stone steps. All in all, I thought it was expensive for what you get. The location and the great staff would normally make me consider staying here again the next time I am in Trastevere, but I need a quieter place to sleep, so probably not.","February 6, 2018","23    Relais Le Clarisse in Trastevere

Location was very central to the major attractions with just a short taxi ride or 20-30 min walk. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Great neighborhood to easily walk to many different restaurants.

1178,"My two adult sons and I stayed here for 3 nights in November 2017. Whilst it’s not in the central part of Rome, it is a short 10 minute stroll to reach Centro Storico from the Trastevere neighbourhood. It’s also very close to the main tram line, so public transport access is not an issue. We had a triple room with a separate entrance from the reception. It was really only a standard room with an extra bed. Facilities were fine but not lavish. Very clean. The bonus was excellent staff who were very helpful (even rustling up 3 breakfast bags at the last minute before an early start at the Vatican for us). The dining facilities were terrific for breakfasts, which was the only meal we ate there, served in the old underground dining area where the then-resident nuns ate. Being very close to a main road into Rome central, I thought it would be very noisy. Not so, thanks to double glazed windows!Trastevere is a very cool place to stay in Rome. It has dozens of excellent restaurants all within a small 4 block radius of this hotel; plenty of historical interest around Basilica de Santa Maria; street art and laid back cafes; and wonderful boutique shops for that unique purchase you won’t get on the other side of the Tiber.

1182,"We really enjoyed our stay at Relais Le Clarisse, a beautifully repurposed old monastery in the heart of the Trastevere in Roma. The room was spacious with high vaulted ceilings, right off the street, but very quiet at night. The bathroom was clean and modern - the whole place a perfect balance of new and old. It was in the heart of Trastevere, our favorite neighborhood in Rome, and a stones throw from hundreds of restaurants, piazzas, and bars. It also positioned us well for our one day blitz through Rome which started at the Coliseum, a 20 minute walk from the hotel, and ended at the Vatican.

If you're looking to hit up the ancient ruins, this hotel is a little far, but still walkable. Room had a very unique feel to it as it is a converted monastery / convent but all the modern fixtures make it a very comfortable place to stay. Service was fantastic and always with a smile.

1184,"PROS: Location is great. The tram is nearby, and hotel is walking distance to most major attractions. Room was clean, bed was comfortable. Soap/shampoo provided were nice quality. Buffet breakfast was good. WiFi worked fine in the room. The receptionist during our stay was courteous and helpful when we needed something. CONS: It was loud (I'm only speaking for the block of rooms that are accessed via a separate entrance around the corner) - not good for light sleepers. Walls are thin; the room doors needed to be practically slammed to close properly. (IMHO, all of that might be somewhat improved by adding carpeting in the hallway to absorbe noise.) Also, there was loud clanking (maybe from old pipes?) in the middle of the night (which we mentioned to reception). Not very restful, unfortunately. We also felt the room was overpriced for what it was - basic and bland. (We booked through Tripadvisor - not sure if booking directly with hotel would have given a better deal.) Perhaps the rooms near reception would have felt like better value (they looked bigger / more nicely furnished, at least on the website). But I'm not sure I'd stay here again unless I got a better deal (and carried good earplugs).","September 21, 2017","23    Relais Le Clarisse in Trastevere

The hotel is in walking distance of all major attractions if you don't mind up to 8 miles per day.

Although in hotels you are limited to their offerings, the owner of this b&b goes the extra mile for you to enjoy your stay. There is a great vibe to this place combined with the friendly atmosphere. Parking is a little restricted since there are more cars around than parking spaces. The rule of thumb: if you park at a blue line you need to pay, whereas white are free.

What a wonderful way to visit and see ALL of Rome. The tour guides picked us up right out front as well as our driver to the cruise port.This time we had time to cook and share a breakfast on the patio for the 9 of us. In the afternoons, after touring, we shared cocktails (or wine) and cheese in the courtyard. It is so comfortable and cozy and especially nice having our own kitchen, fridge etc. The local co-op store is not far away so we were able to stock up on fruit, breads, cheese and snacks. Andre and Maria are great. They gave us a map of the area and suggested various places to visit. Andre can suggest different tour guides too. We arranged our pick up from the airport with Andre and he met us as the apartments. It went so smoothly.

1214,"Rome is a very busy & noisy city. These apartments are tucked in a courtyard off of a main road. We slept great each night. When we arrived we had a tough time locating the apartment because we used my husbands phone GPS! Mistake. It took us much farther down the road and we were on the wrong side of the street. Andrea was patiently waiting for us outsice. We were able to contact him once at the metro stationn which is important. He does not live on the premise. Andrea gave us maps and tips for our short two night stay. You must either pay cash or with PayPal. I didn't realize there was a PayPal fee that we must pay so beware if you use it. On the day we departed we left our suitcases near the locked entrance door and pick them up later in the afternoon .(we had a special key to get in the main door).  The aparment was spacious, clean and comfortable. The kitchen is well supplied with cooking supplies and a gas stove! There is coffee available for the morning which was very good. . Wifi works great. We did not use the TV so cannot review it. There is too much to see & do in Rome! It is a great location with metro close by (10 minutes walk) & Colosseum (5 minutes walk). On of my favorite things to do is to view the Colosseum at night. You feel very safe too. Not like in the early 80's when one wouldn't dare walk around late at night.  The only negative thing is the terrible smell from the pipes in the bathroom. I did read a review that mentioned it so expected it since it is an older building. They just need a special flapper valve on the pipes to fix the issue. We just keep the stopper in the drain and paper in the other hole. It really was not an issue for us. The apartment was very clean. It is cleaned daily too which is not all that common. I appreciated not having to pay extra fees for cleaning, etc.... We had a wonderful stay in Rome!

1215,"We spent 3 nights in the Green Apartments prior to our cruise. Location is a few blocks from the Coliseum and on the Metro line, as well as several of the street car and bus lines. Plenty of restaurants nearby and Andrea will give you LOTS of information on attractions, transit, etc when you check in. Payment is in cash (Euros) at time of check in, OR you can pay in advance via Pay Pal and pay an additional fee for the transaction cost. Do note that while the apartments are declared to be on the 1st floor, this is Europe, and the first floor is up a flight of stairs (no elevator). You will need to haul your luggage up a flight of stairs (we did have help from staff on arrival and when we checked out).We were in Apt 2 which has a window opening to the courtyard as well as one opening to the street in front of the building. Limited ability to block visibility with thin curtains.There is a supermarket a few blocks from the apartments where you can stock up on supplies, or there is a Carrefour Express a bit further away (towards the Coliseum) with a more limited selection.We enjoyed our stay at the Green Apartments","November 10, 2017","25    Green Apartments Rome

Plenty of Ikea furnitures, but the place was clean and nothing was broken.Upon arrival Andrea gave us a couple of maps of the town and a 15 minutes chat about what to visit, where to eat, a few recommendations, etc. To be honest it was a bit short for my taste and I like hotels with a reception always available, however the restaurants recommended were excellent. The woman that showed up in the mornings wasn't as friendly or helpful, however at 75€/night in November 2016 that was cheap compared with decent hotels, so I cannot really complain.To sum up, clean, well located and at a very reasonable price.

He even gave us some great tips on how to hook up with a most charming guide, who took us on a tour of our favourite sites. Best of all, the possibility of preparing a quiet meal at ""home"". Our kitchen was fully functional and well equipped for a simple, delicious italian food.","January 20, 2015","25    Green Apartments Rome

1237,"The apartment was clean and in a safe part of town. It was in walking distance to the Coliseum and Hop on Hop off Bus stop. However, the toilets ran all night, the shower is so small you cannot turn around in it and wash yourself. We could not get the TV programmed to English. Worst of all there was very loud music until well past 2:00 am. We have a 6:00 am wake up and two small children under 10 travelling with us that needed their sleep as well. Although I am submitting this review around 2:20 am, the music is still going strong and we are frustrated because we cannot sleep.","January 17, 2015","25    Green Apartments Rome

Andrea assisted us before we arrived and organised a transfer from the Airport to the apartment. Andrea met us at the apartment and provided an excellent map of the city and guidance regarding where to eat, banks, public transport and areas that he recommended that we visit. It made us feel very welcomed.The apartment was very clean, well equipped and had everything we needed. Public Transport was very close and the Colosseum was in walking distance as advertised.

1240,"We booked a 1 bedroom and got a free upgrade for some reason. No complaints here. The owner was very nice and responsive from the time we inquired re the apt to the time we were there. He actually has his own map of the city and his own recommendations for places to eat and hang out!--more on that later.We had 4 travelers + baby, then had to add a 5th person, minus baby, at the last minute. The owner was okay with this, for a small additional fee--very fair. He did not charge the 5th person the first night she was there which was very nice of him. He even brought an extra cot!The apt is in a very nice location--about 5 minutes (brisk walking)-10 minutes (slow walking) from the colosseum. From there, you can walk along the main street--via dei Fori imperiali--to see the main attractions. There are 2 metro stations nearby--the Colosseum to the west or Manzoni to the east--if you don't want to walk too much. Across the street from the apt is two small grocery stores where we bought water and juice and fruits. There is also a small bakery where we bought our am croissants for breakfast.About the map the owner made himself and gave us--it's better than the map we got from the Roma Pass! There are def some hot spots on his map worth trying out. The apt itself was very nice and secure. As noted, we got a free upgrade to a 2bd/2ba with a kitchen area. The rooms were cleaned daily. The restroom was actually bigger than the standard hotel rr in europe. Wifi is free. The only thing is we do not get new towels daily like we would at a hotel, but it was previously noted new towels only if you stay over 3 days and we were fine. For some reason we lost power the first night and the wifi became slow. We emailed the owner and he was very prompt coming by to fix the problem. Overall we were very happy we booked this apt. Can't wait to come back!","August 31, 2014","25    Green Apartments Rome

1242,"What to say, a great experience from booking to leaving.. Andrea couldnt have made booking the apartment any easier, nothing was a problem.. I was going with my husband and two young daughters for my brothers wedding. I asked Andrea to organise a transfer from the airport to the apartment, which he done. We arrived and were met by Andrea at the apartment, he gave us the tour, showed us the local places to eat, shop and the best way to travel.. information really useful while you stay and gave us a useful map which we took everywhere. The apartment we stayed in was number 3. it had a great wee kitchen, it had cultery, glasses, some pots and pans, washing machine, hob and oven . The rest of the apartment was a bathroom which had a shower, etc, main bedroom had double bed and plenty of cupboard space and then the sitting room was the second double bed when the sofa was made into a bed. There was also air con which is a must when staying in the summer time . There is a tv.. not really for kids viewing, Rome is too nice to be sitting watching it even at night. The apartment had a lovely shared terrace and was great to sit in the evenings in. Maria was in everyday and left the apartment spotless and was so helpful with any of the questions we needed answered. I did do a couple of loads of washing and Maria gave me the clothes horse to dry the clothes on.. The 4 apartments share one between them , there is also a small ironing board and iron , if its needed. We were approx 5min walk from colleseum and was great for walking to Metro station also. There is also free wifi, which is handy to have. I would def recommend The Green apartments for staying in Rome, great value for money and even though there is a flight of stairs to go up to them it was handy to leave the prams at the bottom of them.. If you are looking somewhere clean, close to the sights.. then this is the place.Great place, Great hosts.. Thank you both Andrea and Maria,","July 13, 2014","25    Green Apartments Rome

1244,"We spent 6 days in Rome at Green Apartments, Andrea is very good and he met us at check-in, he took time to explain us everything around and had his own Map printed for us too. He is very supportive. But only down point thing I found as were with kids was that TVs in the room are not child protect. All the soft porn channels were visible, So I advice parents (who doesn't want their child to watch soft porn) to take out the cable and pretend TVs are not working :)Apart from that everything seems pretty nice, We from Sri Lanka and Andrea has been working in Sri Lanka sometime ago and he talk to us about Sri Lanka too.. pretty amazing to meet someone who has spent few years in your own country right :) Travel wise, take blue taxi as they are pretty cheap caparison to others. Plenty of dining places. There is a Sri Lankan food restaurant just 5 minutes walk from the apartment (if you are a Sri Lankan who reading this.) And they are pretty good, away from home and to taste something spicy and chilly. :) Overall the stay in this apartment was pretty nice. But I am sure there are many economical options around if you don't have kids to take care.","May 25, 2014","25    Green Apartments Rome

We saw him several times during our stay and he was always making sure that we were happy and had what we needed. The apartments are a close walk to the Colosseum and Forum. There are plenty of good restaurants nearby. We also found great pastries, a couple delis, and of course Gelato - all within an easy walk! The apartments are an easy walk to two metro stations, which will get you to any attraction. We didn't use the bus, but the bus stop is close by also.

He also gave us a map that included his recommendations for site seeing, restaurants, photo opportunities and entertainment, which was extremely useful and the quality of his recommendations never let us down.

1247,"What impressed me the most about my first-time stay was the time Andrea (the owner) took to introduce my friend and I to his city. :-) When we arrived, he provided a customized map containing info about Rome's ""Must-Sees,"" such as photo ops, restaurants, historical landmarks, transportation lines, etc. He proceeded to sit down with us and explain everything we needed to know, using the map to do it. We were thrilled to be able to catch a glimpse of the Colosseum from our apartment window. The surprisingly peaceful location was excellent--within walking distance of the Red line (Metro) and, in the opposite direction, the Colosseum, Forum, Circus Maximus, etc. The apartment was cleaned every day (thanks to Maria), and provided a comfortable place to relax/crash after full days of sightseeing. Also, the WiFi was dependable for those concerned about that sort of thing. Rome is a city that begs to be explored, so although we didn't spend much time in the apartment, it was a pleasure to have such a place to call ""home."" You will definitely not regret staying here.

It is just down the street from the Colosseum and easy walking to most of the famous sites. Andrea was very kind and helpful. He arranged a driver to pick us up at the airport and deliver us right to the apartment. He also arranged a taxi to bring us to the train station when we left Rome for Venice. Our best pizza and wine meal in all of Italy was right down the street and was one of his recommendations. You should have no hesitation in booking your stay here.

The common patio was a great spot for those wanting to meet others staying at the other suites.

You are about 3 blocks away from the Colisseum and right across from the Colisseum is the subway to take you anywhere. The owner is very accommodating..we arrived early so he arranged for the cleaning person to come early. He also arranged transportation to and from airport and gave us a valuable map to follow. Right next to the apartment, there is an Indian restaurant, which we didn't go to as we don't like that type of food, but there is a pub next door that we went to on several nights to have a burger and drinks...very few people at the pub but the staff was welcoming and very informal. I suspect it picks up late at night and on weekends but we had early trains so didn't go there very late. Highly recommend this rental...you will be very happy.","November 11, 2013","25    Green Apartments Rome

But Andrea (the owner) knew our approximate time of arrival and he was waiting out on the sidewalk in front of the apartment for us!! I am glad because the apartment is set off the street in a small area with other apartments and we may not have seen it. If you are going there, just go in the arch marked 29 and follow around through another small ""tunnel"" area and around to the left and you have arrived. It was clean and just what we needed. Close to all the things we wanted to walk to. Andrea was a great host and sat down when we arrived and showed us a map with all the great sights. We ended up using his map the whole time and not the nice laminated map we had bought and taken with us! We did not cook in the kitchen as we were only there for 2 nights but it would be nice if you needed to cook. Wine on the terrace was great. This would be a great place if you are coming with kids as there is lots of space and set away from the road.

1253,"We needed accommodation in Rome for a family of 4 adults for 5 days in June. When I booked the 2- roomed apartment it was only available for the last 2 days of our 5 day stay, so we booked the 1-bedroom apartment that can sleep 4 (with a fold out bed in the open lounge/kitchen area) for the first 3 days which was also slightly cheaper. We ended up not moving as we spent so little time in the apartment that it wasn't worth the move and extra expense.Our children (19 yr old and 22 yr old) found the fold out bed not as comfortable as they had hoped so although the apartment can sleep 4 it would probably be better for younger children. Andrea was a wonderful host and Mabel friendly and helpful. We found it unusual that when the apartment was cleaned the dishes were not washed. Perhaps this is how it is in Europe? There was a washing machine in the apartment which was fantastic as we used it before we left Rome. The only snag is that it needs washing machine soap powder so bring some along if you intend to use the machine. Racks for drying washing are provided in the courtyard. We highly recommended the accommodation and we would definitely stay there again. Also the map that Andrea gave us was fantastic! We visited most of the places he suggested/were marked on the map (coffee shop/ice-cream shop/pizza).","October 24, 2013","25    Green Apartments Rome

And most importantly, the church that out friends were getting married in! It was only 2 minutes walk away. We had a view of the Colosseum from our apartment which in the evenings was just the place to take a leisurely walk.

1256,"We, a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) from Edmonton, Canada, visited Rome in early July and stayed at the Green Apartments for 4 nights. Our stay was very pleasant, and we will surely stay there during any future visit to Rome.Booking was easy. All the details were available on line, pictures were accurate. The owner/host – Andrea was very prompt in responding to any questions that we had. He also provided us detailed directions and options of getting to the apartments from the airport. He was even waiting for us in front of the apartment when we arrived (we called him from the airport to fix the time).Location of the apartment was great. A short walk to the Coliseum, close to Metro stations, close to restaurants and shopping. We could even see part of the Coliseum from the bedroom (we were in Unit 3 for those who are curious). Andrea was a great host. He welcomed us and walked us through the apartment. Further he also advised us of what to do (and what not), where to go, provided us guidance on visiting the tourist spots, provided advice on how to be street smart when traveling in Rome, options of restaurants etc. He even has a customized map that he hands out to his guests. Further he is always available over the phone, if needed. The apartment was clean and very well furnished to suit our needs. One bedroom with a double bed and a double sofa bed in the living room. Also had a kitchen (fully stocked with pots and pans and utensils), and a separate dining area. Roof top patio was available for use. A cleaning lady came by every day to clean and stock up on the supplies. The Air Conditioning machine worked well and that was very important as it was very hot in Rome in July.The only drawback that we found was that a microwave was not available in the kitchen. We knew about that before we went, so was not surprised. However, I am saying that a microwave would have been very convenient for us.Overall, we were very satisfied with the apartment and our stay, and also with Andrea.

I have visited Rome about 20 times and found these apartments to be excellent. The metro stop is a bit of a walk during the heat of summer (both Colosseo and Manzoni - about 10 minutes), however, that is considered nearby in Rome. The apartment was clean and exactly as photographed, with no unpleasant surprises. Andrea is an absolute gem. He provides a map and gives you an excellent orientation of the neighborhood. He will schedule a taxi for you if you need it. The wifi is EXCELLENT. If you need a 'real' grocery / market (supermercati), there is a Despar nearby. Exiting the apartment complex, cross the street and take the steep stairway up! Veer to the right. You will see an elementary school on the corner. Following alongside of the school, turn the corner, and the Despar is on the left about 2 blocks up.","July 6, 2013","25    Green Apartments Rome

It was so much help! It was a great stroller for the city!Andrea was kind and such a help. He met us on the day we arrived in the apartment and went through where and when to visit certain sites. I was there for work and feeling a bit nervous about how to get to the conference site from the apartment, he quickly put me at ease by letting me know how to get there (so easy on metro B!). Our booking was somewhat last minute, but Andrea helped us by having us stay in Apt 1 and moved us to Apt 2 when it became unoccupied. Both apartments are great.The location of the apartment was perfect. Next to the Colloseo and between the two metro lines. Grocery shops, restaurants, gelato shops, park etc all around. Close to a major tourist site, but totally felt like a neighborhood and away from the beaten path. If you're traveling with kids (or not) I would highly recommend these apartments. There's a terrace where the kids can use up extra energy or where you can have your breakfast or evening rest. Wonderful place and great owner - very attentive!

The apartment owner, Andrea, was extremely helpful, spending at least a 1/2 hour advising us where to go what to see and where to eat on his personally printed city map. We ate at several of his restaurant recommendations and were thrilled with all of them, not a bad one on the list. His tips on how to get tickets at the various museums and archaeological sites were invaulable and saved us long waits in lines. Andrea also was very helpful in retrieving one our party's eye glasses left in a rental car at Ciampino Airport.Our only negative was the poor lighting in the kitchen, needs under counter lights.

1265,"Maurizio and Paola could not have been more accommodating. Our only regret is we only had two nights to stay here. I cannot recommend dinner with Mama Edy highly enough. Also, it's super easy and cheap to get downtown. There is a bus stop right across the street with a newsstand next to it. Buy a bus ticket there which is also accepted on the trains, take the bus a couple of miles to the train station, then hop on the train and you're next to the Vatican in minutes.","July 4, 2019","26    Appia Antica Resort

1269,"It is difficult to summarize just how wonderful our 3 day stay was at the boutique Appia Antica Resort. Our adult family of 6 were warmly greeted by Maurizio and his staff upon our arrival. We were introduced to their luxurious apartments, Pricilla and Ipazia and the lovely grounds. These apartments are fully stocked with all one could need for a week, or a month if you could be so lucky. The hospitality of Maurizio, his wife Maria Luisa and their assistant Paola was unsurpassed. We arranged for an arrival tour with Maurizio of the Appian Way after settling in for an hour or two. What pride for his city and knowledge of its history. We shared a bottle, or two of wine with Maurizio and his wife prior to our wonderfully prepared ""Dinner with the Italian Momma"" which they arranged for us in our apartment. Fantastic! The resort is located outside the city center which was perfect for us. We could travel by bus, metro or taxi as needed and avoided the craziness of downtown. The neighborhood is quiet, is within short walking distance of two markets, a great coffee shop and plenty of quality restaurants. The value for money of this resort compared to other high-end hotels in the city center was a major consideration for us. We were more than satisfied. In conclusion, you will receive the highest level of customer service from our new friends at Appia Antica Resort. The communications throughout the booking process, leading up to our visit and during our stay was top-notch. We thank Maurizio and his team for the best of times during our Roman holiday. We will return for sure. Arrivederci amici.","June 3, 2019","26    Appia Antica Resort

1271,"This was our first visit to Rome and our trip lasted about three days in total. We had been in contact with Maurizio by email to make arrangements before arriving. A courier was waiting for us in Fiumicino airport and it took about 25 mins to arrive at Appia Antica. We were greeted by Maurizio who told us the history of this beautiful house and garden and really made us feel welcome straight away. The inside of our apartment was beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. The fridge was very well stocked with everything you could wish for, so we didn't have to rush out and go shopping immediately. We were even presented with a complimentary bottle of excellent wine and more was available for purchase if required. Having said that, there are two local supermarkets close by, in either direction when you leave the property. The apartment is incredibly well furnished especially the kitchen and a very comfortable lounge, with a good range of DVDs. Maurizio then arranged for us to visit a local trattoria for lunch, which was very good. We asked Maurizio if it was possible to arrange a tour of the main Roman sights for the next day. This was done and the tour itself was really excellent, the main focus being on the Colosseum and the Roman forum. This was a small group tour (can't remember company name) and it was really good.From the property, it is about a 15 minute walk to the Appian Way itself and Maurizio gave us very detailed instruction on how to get there and what to see. He also gave us a bundle of maps and guides to keep. This was a beautiful walk and we both found it an amazing experience to be walking on one of the oldest roads in the world. It is also surprisingly rural and we heard and saw some interesting birds, including a Nightingale and a Hoopoe. The main highlight was visiting the famous tomb of Caecillia Metella, which is about a 45 minute walk.In the afternoon, Maurizio took us on his own personal tour of Rome which included many lesser-known sights and areas of the city. This included an amazing visit to the shrine of the water nymph Egeria, which I don't think either of us will ever forget. In Rome we visited many famous churches, the Jewish ghetto, an astonishing view through the keyhole of the Knights of Malta building and we learnt how to cross the road like an Italian !We can't praise the Appia Antica Resort too highly. It is a wonderful place to stay and Maurizio and his colleagues are the perfect hosts. We are already thinking about our next visit.","May 20, 2019","26    Appia Antica Resort

1272,"I chose Appia Antica Resort because I am writing a novel set in 1950s Rome and I knew that many of the era's actors and directors had villas there. I hoped to learn more about the people and places during my visit and asked if Maurizio could tailor one of his tours to my interest. Well, he accepted the challenge and gave us a fabulous tour, including a teatime conversation with a guy he knows who worked with Fellini! Along the way he pointed out the villa of Gina Lollobrigida and a restored medieval house rented by Liz Taylor and Richard Burton while they were filming Cleopatra (there's a risqué story about this . . .) Honestly, I could not have asked for a better guide and my novel will be all the better, thanks to the sites he showed us and the many, many anecdotes I collected. Maurizio's assistant Paola helped line up the details, including last-minute dinner reservations at a nearby trattoria (they squeezed us in as a favor, even gave us complimentary after-dinner drinks). We felt we were in good hands from the moment we made contact. The villa itself is beautifully decorated--Maurizio's wife Luisa is an interior designer and she has great flair! The kitchen is equipped with everything you need to cook a gourmet meal (great 24-hour supermarket nearby where you can buy the ingredients). We were joined on our last day by friends from Trento and I made a nice Sunday lunch for us all. We sat outside in the beautifully landscaped garden, talked and ate for hours, Italian style. Maurizio contributed a bottle of wine to our little reunion and afterwards he took us in his car to Villa dei Quintili so we could walk off the meal and take in the sites. A perfect end to a perfect visit.Grazie mille!","May 14, 2019","26    Appia Antica Resort

The property is located directly across the street from the bus stop and reasonably close to the train station. We were within a short walk of the Via Apia and of several excellent restaurants. Even though this property is not in the center of Rome it is only a short ride on public transit. The setting is perfect and, I believe, much more relaxing then staying next to one of the major attractions right in the city.","May 12, 2019","26    Appia Antica Resort

1275,"My wife and I celebrated our honeymoon in several Italian cities, and we stayed at this absolutely amazing place for a couple of nights while we were in Rome, halfway through our 2-week trip. As soon as we arrived, we were personally greeted at the gate by Maurizio and Paola, and eventually Luisa. This place is unlike any place I have stayed at previously. It is like an AirBnb because you get access to an entire unit, and like a travel agency because after checking in you can learn a bit of history on Appia Antica and places to visit in Rome (highly recommend). Also, to our surprise the fridge was stocked with typical Roman/Italian drinks/snacks!There were so many exciting things about our stay here that I am likely forgetting to mention things; however, the garden is gorgeous. There is a body of water with Japanese Koi fish, bonsai trees, and unique-looking flowers and trees.For some, the distance from the center of the city (about a 20- to 25-minute drive) might be impractical; however, the peacefulness of this resort and the surrounding Appia Antica served as a much-needed retreat for my wife and I in our event-filled honeymoon. I highly recommend the Appia Antica Resort. The best part of our stay was how welcoming and friendly the owners were.We unfortunately missed our opportunity to sign the guest book, which means we'll have to go back!","April 27, 2019","26    Appia Antica Resort

They are spotlessly clean and very comfortable, have everything you could possibly need for your stay, including a dishwasher and washing machine. A 'Home from Home'. No need to go shopping for the basics as the fridge is stocked with eggs, milk, butter, ham, juice, water etc., and there is a basket with cereals, toast, coffee, tea, sugar and wine, enough to keep you going until you need to go to the supermarket which is located a few minutes walk away. There is a delightful little coffee shop a few minutes walk away, sells the most delicious pastries, lovely for breakfast. The location of these beautiful villa/apartments is perfect, very tranquil, situated in front of the Appia Antica way and close to restaurants, shops and cafe. There is also the 118 bus stop in front of the villa/apartment, which takes approx half an hour to get to the heart of Rome, where you can then choose a tour bus to take you around Rome. Maurizio (owner) and Paula (Customer Relations Manager) are extremely helpful, friendly and very knowledgeable. They are 'first class' professionals, very approachable and really want to help in any way they can, to ensure your stay is awesome! Thank you all for an exceptional stay in your wonderful apartment.

1279,"We are a family of four and had the sheer pleasure of staying at the lovely and welcoming Appia Antica Resort. Our own home is very clean, organized, well maintained and beautifully decorated; therefore, when staying outside of our home, we look for the same. In our opinion, Appia Antica Resort far exceeded our expectations.The Appia Antica Resort is alluring; inviting you to enjoy, with anticipation, more of its' uniqueness at every turn. The attention to the smallest detail makes Appia Antica Resort a hidden gem of exquisite design and architecture. Maurizio's wife is an interior designer. When you visit the Appia Antica Resort, you will be witness to her enormous talented gift.From our first conversation, Maurizio was kind, considerate and professional. Upon check-in, Paola greeted us warmly and even helped to carry our luggage! After we finished checking-in, Paola spent about an hour with us, showing us around the inside of the apartment, as well as, the resorts lush and welcoming grounds. We have traveled extensively and never have we received such personal service! You can certainly tell Paola takes great pride in her position at Appia Antica Resort. The apartment we had the pleasure of staying in was beautifully decorated with fine, luxurious furnishing and a keen attention to detail. The kitchen is fully stocked with every appliance needed. The cupboards are stocked with a large number of the daily essentials; cutlery, cups, mugs, espresso cups, cappuccino cups, plates, cooking pots, pans etc. Our family loves to cook and this is a kitchen we would defiantly enjoy cooking in. It is open, bright and extremely inviting, coupled with all of the necessities to make a lovely meal or snack. There are a variety of complimentary teas, coffee and biscuits, as well; there are cold beverages in the fridge with fresh deli meats and cheese. There is a huge kitchen table to sit at and enjoy all of the goodies Appia Antica Resort has left for you. The living room and dining room are joined. The living room is beautifully decorated with inviting, comfortable couches, chairs and a large TV for your enjoyment. There is a lovely dining table with ample, comfortable seating. The bathrooms are large, clean and plentiful with luxurious linens. There are quality complimentary bathroom essentials for guests to use; just incase you forgot your own. The bedrooms are as beautifully decorated and welcoming as the rest of the apartment, and the furnishings and linens, are of fine quality. The beds are extremely comfortable, and with a TV in every room, it allows time to lay and relax after a day of sightseeing in Roma. The apartment itself is centrally located with access to excellent bus service. There is ample on-sight parking behind an enclosed gate which is private from the main road; however, still providing easy access in and out of the resort. If you would like to purchase additional food, there is a fully equipped grocery store just a five minute walk away. Across from the grocery store, there is an amazing, antithetic Italian restaurant. At this restaurant you will find the best Italian food cook by an Italian Mama! The atmosphere is very inviting and relaxed. We truly enjoyed our time there. There are many lovely, must-see sightseeing opportunities around Appia Antica Resort; each one oozing with an abundance of history. Maurizio is a great historian and will gladly share all of his knowledge with you. A true joy to experience.In closing, it is our wish we will be able to return to Appia Antica Resort, until then, it is our prayer, going forward, each and every lodging experience we encounter is a delightful, professional, fulfilling and as joyously memorable as our time at Appia Antica Resort. Dear Maurizio, Maria Luisa, Paola, Irina and Scarlet, It was lovely to meet you. Thank you for making our time in Roma such a wonderful experience which left us with many priceless lifetime memories.

1283,"We booked the AAR based on Trip Advisor reviews and it did not disappoint. We were travelling as a family (myself, my husband and two children, 8 and 5) and stayed in the one-bedroom apartment which was just right for us. It was modern, clean and very comfortable and had everything that we needed for our stay. It was so lovely to have a well stocked fridge with drinks and foods for breakfast. Maurizio and Paola were extremely helpful and although we did our own thing whilst in Rome each day, they had plenty of suggestions for trips / tours / resturants and things to do as well as advice on travel around the city etc.As previous reviews have said, the AAR is out of the main city but getting the buses in was very easy with the bus stop right outside and this suited us as it was quieter staying out of the busy city. There were plenty of restaurants / shops etc in the local area. As suggested by Maurizio / Paola we took a walk one of the days down the Appian Way into the city. This was a lovely and fascinating walk and it meant we got to see a part of Rome that I'm sure we wouldn't have seen had we not been staying there. Maurizio also took us for a quick tour down the other end of the Appian way on our way bck to the airport when we left, which was a nice way to end our trip.All in all a fantastic break in Rome at a comfortable, peaceful and cosy hotel.Thank you all!","February 25, 2019","26    Appia Antica Resort

1285,"We stayed a week at the Antica Appia Resort (“AAR”) and had a fabulous and wondrous time. Prior to leaving for Rome’s Fiumicino Airport, AAR provided us with detailed transportation instructions and sightseeing suggestions. As soon as we arrived (at 8:00 a.m.), Maurizio (owner) was there to greet us. He had checked our flight and knew that it would be early, as did the high-end car service (Audi arriving and Mercedes departing) that AAR had arranged that brought us to and from the airport. Maurizio spent an hour with us to show us all of the amenities of our suite and how everything worked. It was well stocked with mineral water, sparkling water, eggs, prosciutto, bread, butter, Italian soda & Coca-Cola, cheese, crackers, cookies and wine. Maurizio provided us with a list of recommended restaurants which turned out to be spot on. As soon as Maurizio completed his introduction, we were introduced to Paola and she in turn went over all of the maps and lists that were in the suite and she also provided us with additional maps and information on where to go and how to get there and what tours to take. We have never received such fantastic hospitality and service before, and it continued on a daily basis while we were there. Irina cleaned our suite and made the bed everyday and restocked the refrigerator when we were low on drinks. Whenever we had a question, we received an immediate answer. The AAR is a gorgeous villa and it is set back from the road on extensive grounds. It is protected by an electric gate and has a large parking area for cars. There is a nice pond that is stocked with Koi fish. The AAR is a boutique hotel with trendy suites that have been artfully renovated and decorated. The floors and walls are very thick and it is amazingly peaceful and quiet. It has the high style, look and luxury of an ambassador’s residence. We have never received such exceptional value for cost, as well. In the future, we will again travel to Rome and also visit Florence.

1289,"My friend and I have always liked to explore new cities and for this year’s trip we settled on Rome.We have always preferred to make quick trips but using our time as best as we can. Usually guide books have done the job for us but, when looking on the internet for accommodation, we were intrigued by Appia Antica Resort, as many reviewers talked of how the hotel helped arrange many activities. We decided to spend three days there, after three days on another beautiful hotel in the center of the town.We made a reservation and were immediately surprised by being contacted by the hotel staff, who was wondering whether they could help with anything. We explained our situation and were so happy to receive some lovely suggestions on how to organise our time so that we could do all we wanted to do. Upon arrival, we were welcomed by the owner Maurizio, who, with a friendly smile, showed us the lovely garden (the mere sight of it made us relax) with its zen corner complete with koi pond and carps and the apartment: clean and proper and amazingly decorated.Thanks to the hotel staff’s suggestions, we were able to make the most of our time in Rome and the amazing thing was that, thanks to the clear explanations provided, we knew exactly where to go and how to get there and it made our trip so much fun and stress-free! We truly enjoyed our stay at Appia Antica Resort and will recommend it to all our friends! One day we had a masseuse who came home, to give us a relaxing massage, after one day walking all around the town. Another day, we had a wonderful tour on the Ancient Appian Way with Maurizio, a true expert of the area: he charmed us with the story of Herod Atticus and his wife Annia… (don’t remember!), a true drama of the II century A.C. !We wish there was one in every city, so we could use their help and feel at home as we did here anywhere but – alas!

Mauricio even rent us his own car for the tour, because my husband unexepectadly wasn't able to take bike-tour like the rest of the group.

1294,"We were traveling in Rome with a huge group of friends (about 20 people), so finding appropriate accommodation was not that easy. Choosing Appia Antica Resort was an excellent decision. We booked three apartments and all of them were in the best condition: tidy, stylish, yet cosy. Nevertheless, the most amazing thing about this place is its hosts. We were impressed by the hospitality and care for guests. We will never forget a bike-trip that Mr. Maurizio organised for us in the Via Appia Antica region and combined with his remarkable knowledge about Antique history it was a really exciting day. And the cherry on top - a picnic in the garden that Mrs. Maria Louise prepared for us. Almost all of my friends have been in Rome more than once and stayed in various places, but we all agree that Appia Antica Resort will really remain as our top 1. Can't wait to come back there again!","November 3, 2018","26    Appia Antica Resort

1297,"Our stay at the Appian Antica Resort (AAR) and the wonderful customer service provided to us made our 30th wedding anniversary visit to Rome the most memorable experience. Upon arrival we greeted in the courtyard/gardens of the very beautiful large, house with elements of ""Fascismo"" architecture. Our apartment rooms, kitchen were stylish and clean. The service was at a level that went way beyond our expectations. When our VISA card had problem at ATM cash machines Maurizo personally drove us to an ATM at a larger bank to resolve the problem. Let me tell you, that is when extra personalized service counts the most. Our trip involved finding a special heritage bakery ""Forno a Legna da Sergio"" featured in Dan Leader's book ""Local Breads"" located in the small town of Genzano di Roma in the Castillo Romani on the way to scenic Lago Nemi 20 km south of Rome (see article in FreshLoaf artisan bread baking blog). AAR made the car rental arrangements, provided special guidance on driving, parking, and even mapped scenic view points for the best pictures. We went on Maruizio's half day, in depth Appian Way tour. Walking along the Appian Way is a very romantic experience. He took us to most wonderful bakery after the tour. We had the best white pizza and a special white cherry/custard/pine nut tart ever. We then spent several days touring Rome with a very good semi-private tour AAR arranged for us for the Vatican, Colloseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill. Amazing sights but after experiencing the crowds there it was nice to relax at AAR enjoying a glass of wine that Maruzio had provided us as a gift (he knows wine, food and history well). Also, noteworthy was the Italian Mama meal experience. AAR arranged for Italian mama ""Edi"" to cook a personal meal for us at AAR. Edi is a cooking goddess. Her ""amatriciana"" was better than that of any of the guide book rated restaurants in downtown Rome. It was amazing. Maruizio also took us to local farm market, provided us with gift bottles of delicious wine, treated us to the best coffee, on and on... This was an unbelievable amount of passionately provided service ""con Amore"" Thank you AAR.","October 24, 2018","26    Appia Antica Resort

1298,"Booked the Appia Antica Resort for the first leg of our 25th Wedding Anniversary trip to Italy. We had never been, and were a bit apprehensive about everything. SO many choices. Well, staying at AAR was the perfect choice. Loved the introductory emails from Mauricio. They arranged a lovely ride from the airport to the hotel. Luisa gave us a warm welcome and Paola, armed with a complimentary bottle of champagne gave us the best, most detailed overview of the area we immediately wished we were staying much longer. The apartment was fully stocked with snacks, breakfast items, and more. It was very comfortable. I was amazed by the level of detail with everything you could possibly need for an extended stay... even a small clothes washer! I also have to mention how impressed I was that they had the proper stemware for red and white wine, grappa, Prosecco and more The gardens are magical and the perfect way to relax with wine before dinner. Luisa lights candles every night! Maurizio took time out of his busy day to drive us to dinner the first night and even came inside with us to make introductions. Who does that?!? The courtesy and genuine kindness here completely blew us away. LOVED the location. Not touristy at all and so completely quiet for a good nights sleep. There are many exceptional restaurants within walking distance and the bus stop is across the street. Super easy to buy tickets there if you didn’t want to take a taxi into town. We also enjoyed checking out the local supermarket near by. Was SO cool to experience the Appian Way nearby. Walking in the steps of Caesar! Plus there are other, non touristy sites to see along the way. My only two regrets are that we didn’t stay longer (only 4 nights) and that we didn’t plan time to take one of Maurizio’s tours. However I feel this is a great excuse to come back again! I also want to say that as a TripAdvisor reviewer and follower for years, I was completely saddened to hear recently that some establishments have been accused of paying for or making false reviews in Italy (among other places.) Saying this because I was worried after hearing that that the reviews for AAR might be skewed since they were so glowing. I can personally assure you that no one deserves to have an exceptional rating than this place. Hands down one of the best travel experiences I’ve ever had.

1303,"First. All the reviews you have read here are true; second. you might find Appia Antica is even better. Everything about the resort is designed to make your stay in Rome the best it can be.In no small part, this is down to the care, thought and kindness of host Mauritzio and his team. For example, we had intended to hire one of the two cars the resort provides for guests. However, after our extensive orientation from Paola on the first morning, we abandoned that plan and spent a day walking towards Rome on the Appia Antica itself. A wonderful experience that most visitors to the Eternal City will miss but one that should be a must.Our apartment was spacious, well-designed and comfortable. The housekeeping was outstanding. Guests also have use of the gardens where there are many places to sit to eat or enjoy the sunshine.The resort is 25 minutes or so from Piazza Venezia. The bus service is regular and cheap. A cab is €20 to €25. Uber operates here but regular taxis might be cheaper (all but one of our Uber drivers faithfully followed the Uber map - the other knew a shorter, cheaper route).Thank you to everyone at Appia Antica for making our visit, 25 years on from our Rome honeymoon, so equally memorable.","October 3, 2018","26    Appia Antica Resort

Our two bedroom apartment with pull out sofa was the perfect size for our family of five. The apartment was beautifully appointed and was very clean. It was also a nice treat to have drinks (juices/water) restocked for free each day. We were also gifted a bottle of wine upon our arrival to the hotel. The gardens and koi pond at the resort were beautiful and a nice place to relax after a day touring in Rome.

Prior to our cruise we stayed for a few nights in the Michelangelo suite which has a beautiful balcony with a swing and after we stayed in the DaVinci suite. Both rooms are impeccable and well dressed. Our favorite though was the DaVinci- we just enjoyed the lay out and the balcony on this one a little better, but that’s just our personal preference. The rooms were very clean and had everything you could possibly hope for and more. Alessandro, the owner, is what made our stay the most memorable. He was very kind and went out of his way to help us with everything we needed. When I was feeling under the weather he even offered to go to the pharmacy for me. Anna was also terrific, very accommodating and friendly. I know Italian coffee is amazing but somehow Alessandro’s coffee was better than anywhere else I went.

We may not have stayed here if we had realized that in advance, but the host was very kind and gracious to us. He brought up complimentary wine and some lovely pastries for our evening, not only because of our anniversary but I think because we didn't get the terrace room we were seeking.We enjoyed the breakfast, and the decor of the room was nice as well.

Alessandro was the perfect host gave us good recommendations for restaurants and served a lovely buffet breakfast each morning. The rooms with terraces are superb with a good bed. The hotel is in the testaccio area not far from the circus maximus and colosseum. Foodie market a few minutes away with numerous food stalls and fresh produce. I would recommend this place to all my friends. ,"April 16, 2019","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1328,"My husband and I just completed our stay at Althea Inn. What an amazing find! We were even given a welcoming gift upon our arrival.Beautiful, updated rooms with all the amenities of a 5 star hotel. Alessandro was so friendly, attentive and welcoming from the moment we got there. Breakfast was amazing and Alessandro checked each evening prior on the time we would like breakfast delivered. Bed was extremely comfortable and linens changed daily. There are so many wonderful places to visit nearby and the metro is less than 5 minute walk. We are looking forward to our next stay in Rome and will definitely be staying at Althea Inn again.","April 12, 2019","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1330,"Alessandro is the perfect host, always there, always responsive, and great tips for restaurants, transportation, and in general navigating the sometimes overwhelming and confusing city of Rome. Althea Inn combines 5 star service with authentic charm. I've never been in a place where the host is so present and authentic, and yet not at all intrusive. We loved staying in Testaccio, which is out of the madness of so much of Rome...a real neighborhood--and a five minute walk from all the public transportation you need, so that anything you want to see in Rome is easy to get to, and easy to get away from.","April 6, 2019","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1331,"This B&B is amazing and I cannot wait to stay here again on my next trip to Roma. My daughter and I stayed 2 nights here. Alessandro the owner and manager, is amazing. He can teach a class in customer service. We felt like royalty in our lovely top floor apartment with a huge terrace. We love Testaccio, and the location is perfect--super easy to walk to all our fsvorite restzurants. Our room was large, super clean, and very well appointed. Elegant decor. Super comfortable beds and bedding, Alessandro went out and purchased brand new foam pillows since I am allergic to down feathers. The place is super safe and quiet. Very safe entry. Elevator that works. Breakfast is served in the room, excellent options and coffee was terrific. Alessandro helped us with dinner reservstions, ride to airport, and he helped us when we arrived 4 hours too early. He made sure the room was cleaned as soon as possible and even served us breakfast. Grazie mille! I highly recommend this B&B.","March 31, 2019","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1332,"We found this B&B on Trip Advisor and the reasonable price and 5 star reviews sold us. It was the best place we stayed during our Europe trip. Alexander, the owner, gave us attention from the moment we booked. He was in communication welcoming us and offering his assistance. He is the real deal! Our flight was canceled at the last minute and he refunded that night, which we greatly appreciated. He greeted us at the door upon our arrival, helped with our luggage and showed us our quaint room. It was very clean and inviting. Due to the long travel to get there, I immediately took a shower, and it was luxurious! You will see what I mean, when you go! The bed was comfy and the room was so quiet. There were no ""English"" tv stations, so my husband didn't keep me awake with the tv on! There was even chocolate on our pillow! Alexander brought us a delicious breakfast each morning, to our room, where we sat at a nice table and enjoyed a cappuccino, croissants,fresh fruit, cured meat and bread. It was more than enough to get us going for whirlwind tours. Alexander gave us a computer print out with a map of what bus, trolley or train to take to each place we visited. All public transit is about a 5 minute walk. It was so easy to get everywhere, and cost 1.5 euros. Although, if you go during ""rush hour"" it is definitely an experience with the crowds. My husband uses a C-pap machine (for sleep apnea) and needed distilled water. We asked Alexander where we can find that, and within 15 minutes, he was at our door, with a bottle he bought for us! Now that is service! There are lots of restaurants around the Althea with delicious Italian food. Alexander gave us a list of places we could try Right around the corner is Conrads - a well stocked grocery store. We were delighted with the price of beer and wine there, as well as pizza and pastries! I sat our on our balcony reading a few times, which was pleasant, although not a great view! The neighborhood is not the best, but once you are inside the building, you feel like you are in a palace! There are so many places to choose in Rome, but this place felt like home. Take my advice, book the Althea Inn Roof Terrace, and rest assure you will feel safe and rested, and Alexander will take care of any concerns you may have. Enjoy Rome. It's an incredible city. We can't wait to go back and explore more! And of course, stay at the Althea Inn Roof Terrace!!! Thank you again, Alexander, you are definitely the BEST :-)","March 2, 2019","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1333,"This is a truly excellent little find. The rooms are spotlessly clean and comfortable. We had an extra bed put in our suite and it was absolutely fine. The roof terrace was a delight even though it was February and a bit chilly. Alessandro is the perfect host - he is kind, thoughtful without being intrusive. He provided us with a list of local restaurants - the recommendations were excellent. Ths a fantastic area with outstanding local food including a superb gelateria run by an elderly woman tucked away down a back street. Don't be put off by the distance on the map - it takes only 15 minutes to walk to Circus Maximus. It really is worth it. ","February 20, 2019","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1335,"We stayed here in the first week of November 2018. It is situated in a quiet very safe street on the fifth floor of an apartment building. There is a good lift to the hotel itself. The area has many good restaurants, the owner providing a list of his recommendations. We tried three on the nights we were there, Osteria Fratelli Mori, Trattoria Pennestri and Pizza Remo (this pizza restaurant is a must, such a wonderful surprise) all were just fantastic Italian cooking. Alessandro's hospitality and attention to detail are superb, nothing is too much trouble. The room was modern with a most comfortable bed, and feather pillows. The bathroom was of a reasonable size with a good shower. We had a room with an outside space but unfortunately the day we arrived there had been a heavy shower and the cushions were soaked, so it was not possible to sit on the terrace. The breakfasts, delivered to your room were wonderful, with fresh fruit, ham, cheese, fresh orange juice, croissants and coffee. It took about 30 minutes from the hotel to walk into the centre of Rome, mainly along the river Tiber. It is easily accessible from the main Rome airport using the local train service and then a short 10 minute walk. We would certainly recommend the hotel for a stay in Rome and if we return we shall certainly stay again.","November 10, 2018","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1336,"We loved the Althea Inn Roof Terrace!!! I can't believe I'm just getting around to writing a review from our September stay; (sorry Alessandro!). Alessandro is the absolute best host. I feel like he takes his guests under his wing, making sure you have everything you need for a good stay, including making restaurant reservations, calling for taxis, offering welcome beers, waters and prosecco in the honor bar and offering great recommendations in the non-touristy Testaccio neighborhood of Rome. We were in Rome such a short time and didn't get to see ALL of the sites, but we did get to experience a real Roman neighborhood with great restaurants, a fun vibe and an amazing artisan market (my favorite!) The room was bright and clean and beautifully decorated, and of course, the terrace was amazing; the highlight. So nice to have breakfast, delivered to the room each morning, on the beautiful terrace, which is why I booked this stay. In fact, Alessandro's small B&B is booked most of the time so I actually began our two week itinerary in Italy around availability for this lovely penthouse accomodation. Absolutely happy we did! And the value???!!! Shhhh…! We would have paid much more. If it's available, book it!!!","November 6, 2018","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

Classical bedroom suites (with superb shower room and terrace), sumptiously comfortable bed and spotlessly clean (thank you Anna). The rooms were quiet and well placed, so it is a santuary in the hussle and bustle that is Rome.The host, Alessandro, was very welcoming, helpful and informative. He was never intrusive, but always available and did his utmost to ensure that we had a great holiday. The breakfast (served to your room) is wonderful. The location is downtown Rome, which means that everything is reasonably priced and good quality and it is easy to get to all the sights eithet by Metro or walk - the Tiber is 700m away.Thoroughly recommended.","October 18, 2018","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1339,"Just finished a fantastic stay in the Althea Inn. We’ve been to Rome before and this time wanted a location just outside the hustle and bustle...this was perfect. It’s a 5 min walk from Roma Osteria (train from airport) and 5 mins from nearest metro station. It’s a 20 min walk to the Colosseum or Trastevere, which we really enjoyed. Was great to see Testaccio and enjoyed some lovely meals there.The Althea Inn has everything you need for a comfortable stay, the room was well appointed, but what was fantastic was the terrace outside...A lovely spot of tranquility to enjoy breakfast or a drink on an evening.The thing that really made the most difference was the hospitality of the owner Alessandro. He delivered a lovely breakfast to the room at your chosen time, and even brought us a second coffee 10mins later. He was happy to provide local insight which was much appreciated. All in all, a great break and was very much enhanced by the Althea Inn and Alessandro. Will visit again ","October 14, 2018","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

Although on the 5th floor access is easy via a lift and you are buffered from street noise.There is the added bonus of a private, well furnished terrace.Close to bus lines and train stations you are well placed to take advantage of the good public transport system. There are also many excellent restaurants close by and a large branch of Eataly not far away. The host, Alessandro, was very welcoming, helpful and informative.

1341,"All recent reviews have said it all. If you are looking at the Althea Inn Roof terrace website, trying to decide where to stay in Rome, then look no further. Book here. It’s a real oasis. Delightful Alessandro will look after you really well, answer all your queries and bring you a delicious breakfast to eat on your own private roof terrace. Freshly squeezed orange juice, espresso or cappuccino, fresh fruit salad, lovely bread and prosciutto, jam and croissants. Lovely room and comfortable bed and really quiet. It’s very close to the metro- Pyramide- and buses and trams ( use the Citymapper app on your phone to find out how to get anywhere). And close to the Stazione Ostiense for a direct train from Fiumincino airport. ( details on the Althea Inn website)There are no other tourists in Testaccio and the area might appear a bit scruffy- but there are so many wonderful restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk ( all listed on Althea website- we tried most of them and particularly loved Flavio Velavevodetto).What more to say?!

1344,"We loved our four nights at Althea Inn Roof Terrace in Rome! We arrived around 9:30am straight off a red-eye from the US and were completely exhausted. Although it was too early for our room to be ready, Alessandro and his team were able to get our room ready for us several hours before check-in so we could take a much-needed nap. Our room (Da Vinci Suite) was absolutely perfetto! Comfortable bed, and the private outdoor terrace was gorgeous and a wonderful spot to relax between touristing around Rome. Bathroom was also gorgeous, and had its own set of doors onto the terrace. The inn and room were spotlessly clean. The breakfast, served personally by Alessandro on our private terrace each morning, was incredible! Croissants (your choice of plain or filled... the chocolate-filled were to die for), hard-boiled eggs, prosciutto, freshly-squeezed orange juice (and I am from Florida, this juice was the real deal), cappuccinos, toast; breakfast was just perfect! Don’t be turned off by the inauspicious neighborhood... at first glance, the area seems a little gritty, but it’s a safe, quiet but bustling neighborhood filled with Romans... tourists, not so much. It’s a very authentic Roman experience! While a bit away from the main Rome tourist hotspots (Trevi Fountain, Vatican City, etc), Colosseum was walkable within 20 minutes, and we also walked from Trevi Fountain in about 30 minutes. It’s also right by a Metro stop (Pyramide) and several bus lines. From Althea, nothing in the city was more than a half hour away either by transport or on foot. Trastavere is just across the river, and the wonderfully authentic Testaccio Market is just a few blocks awayA few notes (not detractions at all, just helpful planning items for other travelers): there’s not really a lobby area or area to relax outside your room... but if you have a private terrace in your room, it’s nothing you will miss. The room didn’t have an iron and ironing board but that was seems in line with most places in Europe, and it didn’t turn out to be an issue at all. We were too busy exploring to worry about wrinkles! The Inn is on the 5th floor (US 6th floor, but it will be marked 5) of an apartment building, and can be a little tricky to find at first. The Inn is unobtrusively marked on the building callbox, and once you get in the building and on the elevator, go to 5, then turn to your right and the main desk is through the door marked Althea Inn. The door may be shut... just knock! We definitely walked around in a sleep-deprived daze when we first arrived trying to find it inside the building. Thank you Alessandro for a lovely stay! If we’re ever in Rome again, we will be back! ","September 25, 2018","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1346,"I could not give any negatives about this little jewel. When you arrive Alessandro meets you, carries your cases upto your room. He had arranged the transfers from the Airport. If you know Rome the Train and Metro are a short walk from the hotel, so you could use this if you are comfortable doing so. He then spent time explaining the facilities and talking about the local area, then he gives you as much info about Rome you want or need. He was always helpful and tried to steer you in the best way to make your stay as great as possible. He even had bicycles to use, but unless you are used to riding around roads that are irrational to say the least, don’t try it. But the public transport is only 500 meters away, very cheap 7 euros a day to travel on the Metro, trams and buses who needs a bike.Alessandro brought breakfast every morning which was filling even though it seemed there wasn’t a lot to eat. Very tasty and a great start to the day.If you needed anything during your say he was on hand to help.Rome was tiring but a tick of the list. We stayed for 3 days but to see everything I would say at least 5 days is needed. Although we did see the top 10 places and more. But enough said about Rome.This oasis is a lovely place to stay.Recommend to all.Alessandro thanks again for all your helpMr and Mrs BullockWiganEngland","September 20, 2018","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1347,"I stumbled upon Althea Inn while doing a Google Maps search for something else, but I'm very glad that I found it. It's one of the best rooms I've seen based on pictures, way better than most 4-star hotels in Rome. It didn't disappoint - the room is as expected: homey yet modern. Althea Inn is the whole of Level 5 of an apartment building. It has an old-school elevator, which is ok, but I have to mention that it's a bit of a squeeze. It can fit 4 Asian-sized tourists without bulky luggages/shopping bags. Don't be put off by its location. It is just outside Rome's walls, and bus stops and the train station to Rome's must-sees are just 5 minutes away (max) by walking (e.g. Colosseo is just 2 train stations away). The area is also close to good local restaurants. Gelateria La Romana, the best gelato shop in Rome, is just a few minutes away, but I digress! Alessandro, the owner, was very helpful and proactive even before we checked in. He made sure that everything we require has been organised for us. Breakfast was included in our booking, and he serves this every morning. Italy isn't exactly known for breakfast food, but the best ones we had are from Althea Inn. I can't recommend this place enough! I will definitely book with them if I ever go back to Rome.","September 14, 2018","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

Our room had new furnishings and a very comfortable bed. And an air conditioner that actually put out cold air, something you can't always count on in Rome.

The inn is convenient to a lot of great sites, being only a couple stops from the Colosseum for starters and provides easy access to a lot of the great neighborhoods of central and south Rome. The staff was extremely helpful and readily assisted with every request we made, including arranging car service to the airport. There’s a lot of choices for local food and culture if you’re tired from checking out all the sites. We splurged and picked one of the terrace rooms and it was so worth it! Booking through the hotel website also allowed us to add an included continental breakfast and complementary drinks, both soft drink/water and beer/wine. In regards to transportation it’s tough to beat. It’s within an easy walk of all forms of mass transit, with Piramide metro, Porta S Paolo rail station and the north-south 83 bus line very close by. There was provided a great list of local restaurants in the area as well and you can even borrow a bike to tour around!

We had a room (10 nights) with a terrace which was a perfect place to enjoy a beautiful breakfast delivered personally each morning or to simply relax and enjoy wine in the evening.What really stands out about the property is the excellent customer service provided by the innkeeper and staff and the feeling of comfort they are able to provide.Alessandro, the innkeeper went above and beyond to make our time at the Althea Inn (and my birthday) a memorable one.

If you are a bit of a foodie you will most certainly appreciate the many wonderful restaurants serving authentic Italian fare and the Testaccio Market within minutes of the Inn.If you are reading these reviews and are still on the fence about reserving...don't be! You will not be disappointed. I cannot recommend the inn or the hospitality extended to us highly enough.Thank you Alessandro!!Elizabeth","June 29, 2018","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1356,"My friends and I have just returned from a weekend in Rome. We had a beautiful room in the Althea Inn. On arrival I discovered I had the wrong case. The manager - Alessandro - could not have been more helpful. He drove us back to the airport, helped us sort out the situation, waited until we had filled out all the appropriate forms and drove us back to the inn where a chilled bottle of Prosecco was waiting! The room was clean, beautifully designed and had the most amazing roof terrace where we enjoyed a delicious breakfast each morning. The inn is slightly out of town, but still only a 20-30 minute walk to the Colosseum. I cannot recommend the inn - and Alessandro's hospitality - highly enough. A great weekend!","June 25, 2018","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1357,"Althea Inn Roof Terrace is only two stops on the metro from the Colliseum. We were so blessed by this place and Alessandro who runs it. My friend accidentally picked up the wrong case at the airport and Alessandro took us back to the airport and helped us over the 3 hours it took to navigate lost and found .We were bought a delicious breakfast of fresh orange, croissant and fresh fruit, along with delicious cappacino. Nothing was too much trouble for Alessandro who works so very hard at looking after his guests. The bedroom was spacious, clean and the bedding and products, attention to detail were fantastic. The most beautiful part was being able to sit on the terrace and have breakfast or wine, and being two stops away from this amazing city. Thank you so much Alessandro we hope to be back.

1358,"The B & B is on the top floor of a building, requiring a ride in a very small elevator. Allesandro, the owner, and the staff are pleasant and helpful and the rooms are very comfortable (however I could not get the Italian version of a Keurig to work!) The terrace is attached to only one room, so ask for that room if you want it! Breakfast, as ordered, if brought to your room every morning, and is very good. The location is a good 45 minute walk from the ""tourist"" area of Rome. There is also a very close Metro stop (Pyramid.) Just spend a bit of time scouting out the station area as it is easy to get turned around with the multiple Metro exits at that stop. The Metro is fun and you can easily get wherever you need to. There are also good restaurants close to the B & B. Initially, I was concerned that we were so far away from the main areas we wanted to visit, but once we got our bearings, the traveling became part of the fun.

1361,"Our first visit to this wonderful city was more than enhanced by our four night stay at the Althea Inn. Alessandro’s careful attention to detail ensures that his guests feel very special. On arrival, he greeted us with welcome drinks and we were delighted to find the apartment was as lovely as the website shows, immaculately clean, spacious and stylish. Also, despite the dire weather warnings of rain and thunderstorms promised for the duration of our stay, we found the beautiful terrace to our room was bathed in sunshine and remained so for our whole stay! We enjoyed perfect weather, sunny but not too hot -so much for weather forecasts! The pretty terrace full of flowers and foliage, was so lovely to return to after a long day sight-seeing, a tranquil haven to escape the noise and bustle of Rome; a happy hour spent swaying on the swinging bench with a Prosecco from the minibar to recharge the batteries and reflect on all the awesome experiences of the day. Also in the mornings...a great area to enjoy breakfast, which is brought to you at a time to suit your day’s itinerary, from 7am onwards. The breakfast is, as so many reviews emphasise, delightful: fresh produce, ample and beautifully presented. Testaccio is a good location. You are surrounded by restaurants and bars, supermarkets and banks, so it couldn’t be more convenient. You have an overland train station at Ostiense, a few minutes walk, that goes straight to Fiumicino Airport, and you are also within 5 minutes walk of the Pyramide metro station- then just a couple of stops direct to the Colosseum! And still, you feel more like a local than a tourist- a proper roman experience. An unforeseen bonus was visiting the very lovely cemetery where Keats and Shelley have their last resting place. It’s just around the corner from the Althea Inn, and I doubt if many tourists are lucky enough to visit.With regard to the more well known sights of Rome, I suggested to Alessandro, prior to arrival, that we would appreciate any advice or recommendations he could offer during our stay. He immediately replied, providing links to attractions and museums which require advanced booking. When we checked there was only two time slots left for us to get tickets for the Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel, (four days before our arrival-so check it out on the official site if this is as important to you as it was for us). Alessandro saved the day! There is so much more I could write, but I find I rarely read long wordy reviews so better not write one! Althea Inn-fabulous.","May 21, 2018","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1362,"The Althea Rooftop Terrace B&B is within the walls of Rome. Located in the historic area of Testaccio. There are wonderful restaurants, bakeries and coffee shops everywhere. You are also steps away from many historical sites, checkout the pyramid. Alessandro is there to help you with everythihg. He will deliver your breakfast of fresh fruits, juice, meats, bread, croissants and pasteries at a time you select. I recommend having it on the terrace. The terrace is a delightful outdoor room with flowers and vines five stories above the street, and all yours. The property is lovely clean and well maintained, and you will be staying amoung the romans.If you are a walker everything is close enough to walk. If not, you are moments from bus and rail service.

1363,"I stayed in this lovely, small inn for two nights and could not have made a better choice. I did a lot of research before choosing the Althea Inn and was not disappointed. The inn is in a non-touristy area, yet is well-served by shops and restaurants and a metro stop. My room was very clean, quiet and comfortable. The highlight was the inviting terrace, with comfortable seating, as well as beautiful flowers and foliage adding to the privacy of the terrace. The bright spot of each morning was the delicious, plentiful and artfully-presented breakfast in my room. The inn's proprietor, Alessandro, was always pleasant, helpful, knowledgeable and responsive. I had a wonderful experience at the Althea Inn and would not hesitate to stay there again as well as recommend it to others.","April 29, 2018","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

1364,"Me and my husband stayed in Althea Inn for six nights in April 2018 and we couldn't have chosen a better place to stay in Rome. Our room was very clean, spacious and beautifully decorated. The private terrace crowned the room and served as a wonderful place to relax (and enjoy a very reasonably priced drink from the minibar!) after spending a day walking in Rome.We loved the location of Althea Inn. The historic centre of Rome was only a few subway stops or a short walk by the river Tiber away, but the masses of tourists or the hustle didn't seem to reach the Testaccio area. Instead, it felt like an area where one gets to sense the true Roman everyday life.Above all, what made Althea Inn so special was the wonderful and friendly staff and our host Alessandro. Alessandro was very helpful, sincere and seemed very much devoted to making every guest enjoy their stay. He even helped our friends from back home to organize a birthday surprise for my husband. The breakfast (served to our room every day) was indeed delicious and clearly made from fresh ingredients; a great way to start the day! Alessandro also gave us very good recommendations of the restaurants in the area; delicious dinners right next door and a lot more reasonably priced than in downtown Rome.We would like to thank Alessandro and his staff for a truly nice and memorable stay in Rome, we will definitely be back!Rosanna & Tommi","April 23, 2018","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

We took a chance and booked one of the rooms with a terrace despite the late season and we managed to enjoy a couple of afternoons/evenings out there and we could easily imagine the feeling sitting outside during warmer evenings!The room was cosy and charming and with an adjoining mosaic tiled bathroom. The scented soap and shower products was fantastic and refreshing. The bed was firm and comfortable with fantastic pillows according to my taste.The fully loaded breakfast tray spoiled us every day and was great way to start each morning!We took real advantage of the list of restaurants supplied in the room and enjoyed a lot of good food during our stay.The proximity to the Metro station Piramide ensured swift transportation wherever you wanted to go and yet we were in a very calm area of Rome. That said there were nice restaurants within walking distance among the list of suggested restaurants in the room.We hope to come back soon to Rome and we know where we would like to rest our legs then as well!,"December 12, 2017","27    Althea Inn Roof Terrace

He allowed us to use a local cell phone for the day after we missed a tour meeting time, so we could find the tour guide on site.

1378,"We booked this hotel because of the good reviews from Tripadvisor. We stayed in The Classic Roma for 1 night as our post cruise before heading back home.The location of this hotel is in an old building. Their rooms are located in the 1st and 2nd floors. About 4-5 big rooms per floor. The hotel is situated very near Spanish Steps (2 blocks away and you will be either at the foot of the spanish steps or at the top area). Also, it is very near the Trevi Fountain and Piazza Navona. There is a mini supermarket (expensive) where you can purchase drinks and some snacks. Mc Donalds is just few steps away as well. There is a Bar and a restaurant beside it as well. Sephora is just around the corner.The room is big with aircondition and tv (english included). Bathroom is also nice with amenities included including slippers.Breakfast was provided which includes 3 kinds of meat and egg, pastries and bread, coffee, juices, yogurts, fruits and milk. Everything is wonderful EXCEPT the lift starts at 0 level. It is not in the ground level meaning, you need to use stairs to bring your luggages up(checking in) and down (checking out). After the stairs everything is okay. I love the hotel but i can’t recommend it for older people or PWD as there are no provisions for them. Other than that, this hotel is perfect. Love the interior, love the personnel, the location, the breakfast and even the small lift (very old fashion).Tip: coming out of the building, turn right and walk 2 blocks. After 2 blocks, turn left and you’re at the top of the Spanish Steps. Nice view from the top.Tip 2: Near Mc Donald’s, there’s a Coop supermarket (turn right), you can purchase your snacks and drinks there. Way way cheaper than buying across the mini mart.Tip 3: go to the main road and cross the street, you will be in Trevi Fountain.Tip 4: don’t buy your souvenirs in Trevi Fountain, streets leading to Spanish Steps are cheaper (magnets and keychains only €1 @).","April 19, 2018","28    The Classic Roma

1384,"This was my 3rd visit to Rome in 2 years so I knew I wanted a convenient location in the heart of the city for the 4 night-5 day visit with my adult daughter. The Classic Roma was a perfect choice - it's just off a main intersection of Via Francesco Crispi and Via Tritone - makes it easy to find your way back.. Places like this are usually mid-block - I always look at google earth when doing my planning to see where the front door is. In this case, the Sephora store is on the corner, then a restaurant, then the front steps of Classic Roma. From the sidewalk there are 2-3 steps to the front door and once inside another 4-5 steps and then down the hallway to the elevator. It's a one person w/luggage kind of elevator, so we did the stairs. Across the street there is a Deutsche Bank with ATM access and a taxi stand. It's only 2 blocks from Fountain of Trevi which we visited at different times during our stay. We were just a 15 minute walk to Villa Borghese which was also on our list of places to visit. It's so convenient walking to all the major sights - from Piazza Popolo to the Coliseum, Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. If you're sightseeing, it's a good choice.We stayed in Room 6 which was on the street..a little noisy but we bring ear plugs, so wasn't a problem. I'd rather have a view with a little noise than look at a building wall. I believe there were just 6 rooms total. Our room was pretty basic, clean and comfortable but that's fine with us as we are only there to sleep. Breakfast was served in a dining room across from our room. A nice selection of pastries, fruit, coffees, juices, eggs were hard boiled and scrambled. The twin beds we requested were fine - a little firm as most Italian beds are - extra blankets and pillows were nice to have. No problems with the bathroom. I liked that that were several local restaurants, not just touristy places to dine in the evening.. We were very pleased with our stay at Classic Roma.","November 14, 2017","28    The Classic Roma

1391,"We've been to Rome several times before and stayed in hotels in other areas, such as Trastevere and Termini, which were all great too. But The Classic Roma had everything we wanted. We had a big spacious, very clean, and comfortable room. Breakfast (not included in our package) was purchased for only 5 Euro and you get a simple but filling buffet of coffee, meats, cheese, cereals, some salad and juices. It's location was very convenient. You were practically at the center of Rome. Fontana di Trevi was less than 5 minutes away. All the others were walking distance. Barberini Metro was also 5 minutes away. A big plus was the helpfulness of the receptionists. Giorgio, though he knew we've been to Rome before, still gave us lots of tips and suggested new sites to visit. He made checking in and out smooth and convenient. Elena, the other receptionist, too was helpful . When we asked her to make a restaurant reservation at La Taverna dei Fori Imperiali, she promptly called and we were able to got the last table for the night. Another receptionist was also helpful in booking us a taxi. They were all friendly. And to top it all, their rates are so reasonable.

The location is the best part about the hotel.The people were very nice and pleasant too.The not so nice things about the hotel follow. The room was extremely small, even by Rome standards. The bed was so tiny that my husband's feet hung off the end of the bed. There was about one foot between the bottom of the bed and the wall. One There was not alot of room for luggage. There was a closet and one luggage stand. We used the small desk for our other luggage and there was no room for our carry ons.The shower was so small that you could not bend over to pick up something if it fell. It had a rain head shower, but there was no way to get out from the water because of space. Shaving your legs was impossible in it. It also leaked all over the floor outside the shower.The room needs paint desperately.The building itself has peeling paint on the ceiling and broken floor tiles. The hotel occupies only part of the building and the reception is on the 2nd floor. There is an elevator, but if someone happened to leave the manual doors open on another floor, it ceased to operate.Lastly, it is a shame that a hotel that includes breakfast charges for using coffee in the room.We enjoyed our stay, but they should spruce up the entrance and the rooms need paint.","January 5, 2017","28    The Classic Roma

1412,"The best thing about this hotel was the location - very close to everything including metro stop, Termini, and Trevi fountain. Good restaurants and gelato nearby, plus a supermarket. It’s hard to find a room for a family of 5 in central Rome for a reasonable price, and we were quite comfortable and had plenty of room (2 adults, 1 teen, and 2 kids). The elevator is small - two people at a time - but it’s the largest that could be retrofitted into the building and I was glad not to walk up 6 flights of stairs! The room was very clean and quiet - we did not see or hear any other guests during our 8 nights. We stayed over Easter and they left a lovely basket of candies and pastries in our room for Easter Sunday (see photo).The bathroom - often had a sewer smell that must be from old plumbing and unavoidable. It was also narrow - only one person at a time for sure. But again - old building and unavoidable.I was a little disappointed in the breakfast - having stayed in many other European hotels with a breakfast, I was accustomed to a small breakfast room with staff making food, fresh cheese/meats, cereals, yogurts, and such. In this case, there were beverages in the fridge and assorted packaged pastries on the counter. We did not starve of course, but it was different than other European hotels so I want to mention it.Overall we would most certainly stay here again - it was safe, clean, and well-located.

Skip the breakfast (they have a buffet but it is a bit odd to an American) and go local, since there are many good cafes in a block or two. Bar was good for afternoon beer and snacks. Shower was modern. Many local restaurants within a few minute walk. Castile San Angelo a stone's throw away. Staff was very friendly and helpful, fluent in English. The doorman called taxis in a flash. We navigated using the Courthouse and River. A bank with ATM is a half block away. Took 20 minutes to St. Peters, 30 mins to Pantheon or Trevii, about an hour walk to Forum, Palatine Hill. Nice dessert, candy shops, and gelato cafes really close to hotel.

The bed was comfortable but I must say that this was the smallest room we stayed in in Italy. No real view. Fortunately we were out a lot.

Unfortunately we had some issues with the USB ports next to the bed. Maintenance quickly resolved the situation and sincerely apologized. Housekeeping provided double turn down service which was unexpected and greatly appreciated. Had two meals at the hotel. Breakfast on -1 level was cold (they ran out of eggs) and Pasteries didn’t taste very fresh. Also had dinner at the lobby lounge and asked for a medium steak. The steak arrived very rare and didn’t taste very good.Definitely skip dining here and venture out. ","May 10, 2019","30    Le Meridien Visconti Rome

Drinks were overpriced and the bar staff didn't seem capable of making anything that wasn't on the bar list.

Walking time from there you can take in Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Fontana de Trevi, and the Spanish Steps within a half-hour and another 20 minutes or so back.

1479,"Good, albeit brief stay here in early April. Location is fantastic - 5 minute walk to Castel Sant’Angelo and then obviously just a bit longer to the Vatican. When I arrived for check in, Francesca was extremely helpful with both getting me sorted with an upgraded room as well as with a recommendation for lunch. The lay-out of the guest floors can be a bit confusing but the good news is that the hotel isn’t huge so you won’t be roaming for long in search of your room. My room was very nice: decent size, comfy bed and very bright. This hotel doesn’t have a concierge lounge but it does have a rooftop area - unfortunately, it rained quite a bit the afternoon / evening of my stay so this area was closed. I’m sure it would be a heck of an asset when the weather is nice...can only imagine the views from up there.The lobby & bar area always seems to be busy. On the day I was there, they were hosting a large conference. In fact, it seems like there was a small event in the bar / restaurant area over lunch. Around 3.30/4p, my colleague and I were looking for a space to get some work done and the employees in the bar area prevented us from sitting, saying that they needed to clean the area. Thirty minutes later, when there was no effort to clean the tables, I asked Alessandro who appeared to be the manage of the bar area. I was taken back by his remarkable lack of empathy and guest alignment in his responses to our requests. Once the table was ready, it became obvious that we they just wanted to prepare the area for dinner and that we were basically a bother. Considering that there is no lounge or workspace in the guest rooms, I would have thought that the hotel staff would be more accommodating to guests trying to get some work done in the common areas. This whole thing was a big turnoff for me.All in all, for 261 Euro/night for a hotel in central Rome, this was still good value. Would consider returning for a holiday but likely not for business.","April 22, 2019","30    Le Meridien Visconti Rome

We enjoyed both outdoor spaces: the rooftop bar, and the seating area off of the lobby. It was nice to sit and have a drink and relax after a full day of sightseeing. The location was great too. We walked to Vatican City and many restaurants. One night we went to Travastere for dinner but chose to take a taxi. What really made our experience 5 star was the staff. They were all incredibly nice and helpful. They called taxis for us and made dinner reservations. They did it all with a smile as if we were the most important guests.

We came back to the hotel after a late dinner and there was an air conditioning problem. They moved us quickly to another room and then moved us to a better room in the morning.

They adjusted our bill more than expected and had refreshments delivered to our room for the inconvenience.The rooms were all large, clean and comfortable. They were also well appointed.

1489,"I am an SPG/Marriott member since 2007. Platinum status for 9 years, currently Elite Ambassador - last year I stayed 140 nights with SPG/Marriott and spent tens of thousands of dollars doing so (some of my own dollars and some of my company’s). I reserved two rooms at the Le Meridien in Rome for the weekend and was upgraded to an executive room from a superior. Sounded good so I did not question it, however, I soon found out an executive room is not much bigger than superior and is not really much of an upgrade. I asked if I could be upgraded to a suite for at least one room, but they told me they were sold out and there was nothing available - maybe Saturday a suite would be available. I found that strange considering suites had been available when I booked. I looked on-line and it was no surprise they had suites still available (it was 4:00pm, so it wasn’t early in the day). I called my ambassador concierge and asked her to intercede, which resulted in the hotel providing one suite. Overall, my experience with the Le Meridien in Rome is as follows. (1) They did not want to provide a commensurate upgrade for my status, (2) they lied about having suites available and I had to spend an hour of my time in Rome fighting with the hotel to get an upgrade, (3) there was no platinum check-in line. Overall, just a very lackluster reception for a long term member.We are loyal Marriott members and when we travel we make an effort to stay at Marriott properties. I travel a lot for business, but also travel for pleasure. After 140 nights of business travel, I want to de-stress and get away from the daily grind and get a decent upgrade for a family trip. Having to spend an hour of our limited time, fighting to get an upgrade is stressful. It also starts the trip on a negative tone plus we look like jerks because we have to forcefully ask for upgrades or else we will not be taken seriously. I recommend you do your homework prior to arriving as I do not think it’s their policy to look after Marriott reward members.Upon check out, the desk attendant told us that they get so many platinum members that they just can’t upgrade everyone. Ok. I guess Ambassador Elite members are just a dime a dozen - that makes me feel a ton better. There were some good points. Aldo in the breakfast area - makes the best cappuccino in Rome. Breakfast was pretty good as food goes, but it is unfortunate the breakfast is in the basement. The rooms were very clean - the cleaning staff is doing an excellent job. I know the manager Alessio often responds to Trip Advisor reviews. When I asked if he was present in the hotel, I was told yes. I really thought since I asked for him by name, he would at least check in with us at some point. He did not. I hate making a bad review. I thought a lot about whether to write this. Fundamentally, however, all we wanted was one out of the two rooms upgraded. We didn’t ask for anything else. We didn’t ask for special favors, special services, no crazy requests. Just one upgrade to suite, in a hotel that had availability on a non-peak weekend. ","March 18, 2019","30    Le Meridien Visconti Rome

Context set.I will start by saying I will use this hotel again whether for business or pleasure. Bedroom was clean comfortable and perfectly adequate for a four day stay. The lobby area is busy and other than for a short linger is utilitarian as opposed to comfortable. The bar is overpriced. The availability of a computer and printer just off the lobby is useful. The wifi in the room is good.Breakfast was good if a little chaotic. The ability to cope will a large crowd seemed to challenge the staff so the result was that there was plenty of choice but lots of waiting in between.

That's not to say it's in a remote location, it's just the street isn't as busy as most in Rome. Our whole group were silver-haired but we had no trouble walking to most of the major sights in the city. We were also no more than 15 minutes away from the subway station at Piazza del Popolo so public transportation was available when needed. All the people working the front desk were very friendly and helpful during our stay. The breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and had a wide range of choices so no complaints there. Our room wasn't large but we had enough space for storing our belongings and the king sized bed was very comfortable.

It caught my attention as being value-priced, and part of the new Marriott-Starwood family, so stayed here to top up my nights to qualify for Platinum. Clean rooms, and the heating worked well (as it was a fairly cold December week when we were there). The bathrooms are a bit small, especially the showers. I'm a bigger guy, and could barely turn around in the shower, but the water was hot and the water pressure awesome. Probably the highlight of our stay was the breakfast that was included as part of my Platinum benefits. My daughters loved the selection of foods and the quality of what was available on the buffet. Compared to other hotels we've stayed in, this included breakfast is one of the best we've had. We found it easy to hail Uber vans to get everywhere we needed to go, and on one nice day we walked to the Vatican in about 30 minutes along a cool shopping street that seemed to cater more to locals than the tourists.

After a brief passport check (to confirm identities, not to keep) Morris handed us a map and spent a great few minutes telling us where we could visit besides the main points of interest.He circled various food places, hidden gems and the best churches (there are loads). He carried on with a few bits of key details and then handed us a couple of discount vouchers for nearby restaurants. We later visited La Famaglia (one of those recommendations) which turned out to be both well priced and delicious, lovely pizza and steak (yes, steak, my partner had maxed out on pasta).The room had everything we needed, including a hairdryer, a mini bar, a safe, and thankfully air con. We ended up receiving some complimentary wine too, which was a lovely treat.Other reviews have mentioned noise issues, but largely it was quiet, there are signs asking for silence in the corridors and respectful noise levels in the rooms. It works, apart from the odd conversation from the hallway it was extremely peaceful. It's located within a 30min walk of nearly everything but the Vatican, luckily the hotel is very close to the metro which takes you there for €1.50 single. So not a problem at all.As a side note nice little extra we recieved when we left was an offer to keep our bag at the hotel post checkout. We had a late flight but Morris was happy to keep the bag with him till we needed to leave. Very much appreciated.We would definitely stay here again! ","July 5, 2019","31    Morrisson Hotel

Upon arrival we were a bit confused as the hotel itself is on the fourth floor! I must point out this is not a hotel and is an apartment, we stated in the title. It’s very small and you genuinely feel like you’re the only people there. The place was spotlessly clean which is an important thing for me so I was very impressed!The room itself was modern, comfy bed, nice bathroom with so much storage. There’s a window you can open and very nice air conditioning. There was a safe in the room to keep your valuables too which was free to use. The only fault with the room was the thin walls but luckily we didn’t have any noisy neighbours.The staff here are very friendly and helpful, there’s someone on reception every day until around 3pm. The gentleman who I assume is the owner was very knowledgable about the city and gave us some useful tips before we set off out. I’d definitely stop here again as it was everything we wanted from the trip and would recommend for any couples / single people travelling to visit Rome.

Exit the lift and Morrissons Rooms are on the left. Check-in went well. Victoria gave us huge amounts of info and secret places to visit in Rome as well as good value restaurants.Our room was very quiet and serviced every day. Comfortable bed, good shower, very clean, mini bar, kettle for tea/coffee.Breakfast is taken in a café 2 minutes walk away. It consisted of the typical Italian sweet pastries which is the norm. The staff at the café were very obliging and happy. Don't be put off by having to walk to a different location for your breakfast. It really is not a problem and in fact it is interesting watching the locals go by and come in.If you are looking for a very quiet place to stay in Rome, this is it. Only 10 minutes walk from the Termini rail Station.If you are in Rome to party, go back to your room late, be noisy, then seriously this accommodation is NOT for you. There are plenty of notices advising that if you do make unacceptable noise then your booking will be terminated. End of. I had no problem with this.

It's in a great location, about a 15-20 min walk to the main Termini station, 1.5-2 miles to most of the big historical sites in Rome (except the Vatican), in a safe neighborhood, and just around the corner from one of the best gelato places in town (La Romana).Pros: good location, room was very clean and the Morrison staff was very helpful and friendly. They really care about their guests experience while visiting and it shows. The outside of the building looks a bit rough but Morrison's itself (inside) is clean and modern.Cons: breakfast was not served onsite. You have to walk 2 blocks or so to a little place where the staff didn't really seem to like dealing with non-Italian speaking guests.

Old Rome is a short walk away and for the slightly further away sights, 2 Metro stops are an even shorter walk away.The room itself was spotless and neatly laid out, the bed was very comfortable and (most importantly for me) the shower has excellent pressure.

1536,"Morrisson is a suite of 5 rooms in a typical building in Rome, shared with apartments and another similar setup called Deseo. Don't be put off by the exterior-- everything in Rome is ""gently worn,"" and there's really no disadvantage to your stay itself. Imagine it as a 5 bedroom apartment, each room with en-suite baths, and a small entryway where the reception is. It's no frills, but everything is immaculately clean and recently renovated; the bathrooms were nicely appointed and have A/C and window that you can open to let in fresh air (assuming it's not oppressively humid!)-- it gives you a little taste of normal ""living"" in Rome. We took the train from Fiumicino to Termini and walked 10 minutes to the hotel-- the street it's on, Via Palestro, actually does have quite a few bars and restaurants, as well as other hotels on it; try Mamma Angelo's if you're looking for something nearby; we found it on yelp, and were very satisfied with the food.Check-in was quick and painless. The manager was incredibly exuberant and enthusiastic, with lots of good tips. We were initially a little nervous how close everything was to each other, since it is literally 5 rooms off of a single hallway, but we actually never crossed paths with any of the other guests, and didn't hear any of them, with the exception of the water running when they were showering. The room itself was exactly like in the pictures- no frills, but met all of our needs. The only thing I didn't love about it was that there was a bedspread but no blanket/comforter, and it wasn't obvious whether it had been freshly washed; but it could have just been a little worn.It's definitely not in the city center, but it's stilil accessible. We basically walked to all the sightseeing spots which are mostly 20-30 min walk away, with the exception of the vatican, which you can walk 5 minutes to the subway station, take an 8 min train ride, and walk another 5 minutes to get there. Also, the 62 bus around the corner takes you straight into the centro storico and passes by a lot of major stuff such as Trevi Fountain, the Fountain of Neptune, the Pantheon, etc. It's really not difficult, and you can buy the bus tickets at the Tabacchi that are all over the place. We left one morning at 4am to catch a 6:30 flight-- to get to the airport, you can take the Terravision bus from Termini for four euros, which was really convenient (and costs half as much as the train). Oh, definitely go to La Romana, the gelateria around the corner. It's totally worth it-- we don't even like ice cream and gelato, but ended up going four times! There's often a line, but it moves relatively quickly :)","October 15, 2014","31    Morrisson Hotel

Easily accessible by subway, bus, however, a few minutes from Termini station.The whole is enhanced by the kindness and sympathy of the charismatic Morrisson: a person extremely helpful and worthy of the place it manages.Breakfast is included and is expendable in a bar a few feet away.The rooms are spacious and bright.Hard to find a facility so beautiful and so comfortable at a price like this ... Definitely will be back and definitely recommend to our friends and acquaintances!","May 19, 2014","31    Morrisson Hotel

1545,"We start from the position: perfect! It is located a few meters from Porta Pia and Via XX Settembre, Castro Praetorian metro station and 2 minutes walk to the terms.With a lovely walk you can visit many attractions of Rome. Let us now turn to the structure: excellent!The hotel is located inside a building, on the fourth floor (ascensorato of course), and everything, absolutely everything is brand new! The rooms are beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, new and modern furniture,minimal style, soft lighting, perfect bathroom, great shower. Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel. Finally, the staff: impeccable! Rarely do I choose a hotel or confirm the quality of the staff, but this deserves a special praise. The owner immediately puts at your disposal,excellent advice and high availability. In short, the final judgment: comparable hotel in a good 5 stars!

1547,"A short stay in Rome over the marathon weekend where everywhere was busy. We arrived late, but emailed the hotel prior to arrival what time they should expect us. There was a member of staff waiting for us. An enthusiastic, bubbly person who explained everything to us - the room, the nearby area, what to see, where to go. The hotel is probably a 10 minute walk from the main station (Termini) and conveniently located in the area of embassies which makes it a safe and quiet spot. The rooms are comfortable, big and very clean. Mini bar is reasonably priced. In the morning you get a voucher for breakfast in a cafe near the hotel: in a bar (45 Via Cernaia). It is possible to walk everywhere from the hotel - the main attractions. I have to say that our stay was particularly nice due to the choice of accommodation. They offer luggage storage too - which is great if you need to check out but have time to do more sightseeing.The staff who work there are amazing - friendly, positive and extremely helpful!!!! It deserves another star!","March 31, 2014","31    Morrisson Hotel

1548,"We stayed in a 4 bed room which had a comfortable double bed and 2 full size singles as bunks. It was spotless, cleaned daily, had a safe and ensuite. Staff were friendly and helpful. Hotel is a short easy walk from the station and about 40 minutes on foot from most of the main ancient sights of Rome. There are restaurants/bars/supermarket a few minutes away. Breakfast was in a nearby cafe. It was perfect for our family city break and I would recommend anyone to stay here.","January 5, 2014","31    Morrisson Hotel

1549,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in Sep 13. The hotel is situated 8 mins from Termini station but is in a much nicer location than the station. The hotel is on the 4th floor and it only has 5 rooms and the standard of the rooms is very high. It is a little bit out of the centre but as long as you don't mind walking then this actually works out well as I think value for money it is much better than staying right in the centre. The room looked small when entering but is actually much bigger than my initial thoughts and we had more than enough room for the 4 nights we stayed. Rooms were cleaned to a very high standard daily and the hotel reception were very helpful. They left croissants and cake in our rooms a couple of days. Breakfast was traditional Italian at a local bar with croissant, coffee/tea and orange juice. We thoroughly enjoyed out stay at this hotel and would recommend it to anyone!","September 24, 2013","31    Morrisson Hotel

1550,"We arrived in Rome for the first time last Sunday and were beginning our first time to Italy by staying here for three nights. I have to admit that I am more used to the larger chain hotels when we go on a city break (e.g Hilton, Marriott ) but having studied trip advisor in conjunction with comparing the prices and location of other hotels I opted to book this establishment. I hesitate to call it a hotel because it certainly doesn't come close to that in terms of my ""concept"" of a hotel. It is on the 4th floor of a residential block of flats and is designed on the name badge as -Executive Rooms. We walked from Termini station following the directions given by the hotel in an earlier email and they were fantastically accurate in their terms. There is an elevator albeit very small and were allowed entry to the property. We were met by a pleasant receptionist who took our details and showed us to our room. We arrived at 11.30am and I had half an expectation that we would be allowed to leave our luggage but be sent away until cleaning of the room from the last guest had taken place. Thankfully we were allowed to move straight which was welcomed as we'd had a very early flight from London and the temperature was already reaching close to 30•. We had air con which was individually controlled by us and the room was quickly cooled to a comfortable level. There were only a handful of rooms at the most and the lighting of the reception area and the room corridor was aimed at creating a certain mood it did verge upon slightly seedy. Don't get me wrong there was nothing seedy whatsoever about this place, quite the opposite but it was just a bit dark and maybe trying a bit too hard at trying to create an ambience which was a tad affected. There were plenty of towels and free toiletries and we in fact both nodded off for a bit before freshening up and starting our adventure . When we arrived we were required to pay our city tax in cash and separately from our bill which wasn't a problem but my husband didn't have any denomination of cash under €50. We were only charged €12 but the receptionist didn't have any change. I expected her to say that we could pay upon our return back to the hotel later that evening but instead she took the whole of the €50 and told us that we had to wait till the owner/manager started his shift later that evening before we received our change. I suppose I may be criticised for being a stingy Brit (!) but we weren't talking about a couple of pence, we were talking in excess of £30 and the manager was not due in till late evening ! Again with hindsight perhaps I should have said no that's not acceptable, but we were hot, tired and I suppose not wanting to create any atmosphere when we had just walked through the front door of a strange city. Again I had never come across that way of thinking on my travels and was slightly taken aback. To be fair when we did meet the man himself later that evening he had the money waiting and in fact he offered it almost immediately to us which restored by faith. We had a good nights sleep and awoke fresh and raring to go. My husband went for a shower followed by me and I was in the process of applying conditioner to my hair when he came to the bathroom to tell me the owner had just called the room to complain that we were using too much water ! He was laughing when he said it and initially I thought he was trying hopelessly to be funny but soon realised through his insistence that he was serious. This was a hotel for which we were paying almost £100 per night and for which we were being told when to turn off the shower tap!!! We are not environment unaware people and I fully appreciate the concept of world sustainability but I have never been monitored in a hotel by the water police. I did as asked but did wonder whether we had perhaps made the wrong choice of hotel. We then had a pleasant albeit small breakfast at a nearby cafe and enjoyed the rest of our day. We enjoyed our next day too and found that on both days our room was fresh and clean upon our return. We did notice that our door was not secure though and I made a comment to the lady at reception regarding it and she said that she had just finished cleaning it on both occasions. There didn't appear to be other guests around and we did have a safety deposit box so wasn't overly concerned. The bed was comfortable and there was adequate space for our luggage and clothing. The location is good for its proximity to Termini station and it felt safe. A side of The British embassy is in fact on the same street as this place and there is obviously a security presence as a result of this which isn't necessarily a bad thing. There are a few decent enough places to eat in the area but try to keep away from those directly at the station as they seemed overpriced and pretty underwhelming. Would I come back again to the Morrison hotel? - well funnily enough that is a question I asked my husband on our last night. For cleanliness, comfort, convenience of location and value for money yes I think we would but if the Hilton or some other established hotel had a similar price I think we opt for them given the few little ""quirks"" of this place.

1551,"We stayed here for 3 nights on a long weekend trip to Rome. The location is very good, a little out of the centre but within easy walking distance from the Metro and main bus/train terminal (Termini). The staff were very friendly and helpful, and explained everything perfectly. The room was very modern and comfortable, it was so nice to come back from a busy day sightseeing to relax for a few hours before heading back out in the evening. The free wireless access was a bonus - there are two wireless signals (morrison and morrison 2), if you dont get a a good signal with one try the other, it worked fine for both of us on our iphones. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you want a comfortable tranquil place to stay within easy reach of Rome city centre and the main sights (Colosseum, Pantheon, Roman Forum, Vatican, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps etc)","April 21, 2013","31    Morrisson Hotel

1552,"The hotel is just a short walk from the heart of the action in Rome, in a nice quiet neighborhood. Its actually good that your not right at the foot of the Spanish steps as its nice and relaxing. Morrisson the guy who operates the hotel couldn't be nicer and really went out of his way to help us with all of our needs. The rooms are clean and modern we actually stayed here twice as we had to come in and out of Rome and we were happy to be here not just once but twice.","September 17, 2012","31    Morrisson Hotel

1553,"Our group of four stayed at the Morrisson hotel for two nights. The room, while small (to be expected in Rome), was super clean, modern and comfortable. The ac was great, the beds were comfy, and the shower was roomy enough to turn around in. The hotel staff are absolutely excellent and super helpful. The owner even got us croissants on the morning we left because we were missing the free breakfast. We would definitely stay there again and plan on recommending to our friends.

1554,"I stayed here with my partner for 3 evenings in room 402 at the end of April. This hotel was a great find. I put in a lot of effort before my trip to determine what hotel I should go for. Rome is not a cheap place to stay, but this hotel ticked all the boxes, for a very reasonable price. The clean, comfortable rooms were a joy to come back to after a day's sightseeing, in the knowledge that the room would have been tidied, with fresh towels like clockwork!There are five rooms on the fourth floor of an older style apartment block. Do not in any way let this put you off as the rooms are all brand new, and the fact there are only five rooms means that the service provided by the staff (especially the owner!) is far above what you would expect from a central European hotel.As for the location - the weather in Rome when I was there was superb, and despite the hotel being close to stations on both lines of the Rome metro, and bus links on the road a block up from the hotel, we decided to walk pretty much everywhere. The Colosseum, trevi fountain, vatican, parks and spanish steps are all well within walking distance, as are the nightlife spots within the city. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Termini station, and the location of the Ryanair bus drops for Ciampino and Flumancio airports. The location is very safe - within the area of the city mostly taken up by foreign embassies. We never at any point had any issues with going for a quick wander round the local area, where there were a number of lovely bars & restaurants. WIFI - I note that this had been a sticking point for some reviewers, but there are now two access points, and the wifi works perfectly.Breakfast - The breakfast in the small cafe round the corner is an absolute delight, and a perfect way to energise yourself for the start of a long day's walking!I'll leave my last words for the staff. All the staff were exceedingly helpful, and were more than happy to answer any questions we had regarding the local area, or a wee bit further out. They were always up for a chat and conversation about our day, and seemed genuinely pleased of how much we enjoyed ourselves.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Rome. I genuinely believe you would not be able to beat the level of service/location/quality of the hotel at the price anywhere else in the city.Will definitely be back.","May 2, 2012","31    Morrisson Hotel

1556,"Everything descriped earlier applies except for the negative review. The outside of the building is not looking very fancy and a bit anymonous and therefore it is not recognized as a hotel. Having said this the rooms are very new and very nice including the nice bathroom. So if you are looking for a nice room to stay at a good location and don't mind to take the steps or an old small elevator ( planned to be renewed in the future) then this is a good choice. We hesitated hearing about the breakfast at a local bar but we really enjoyed since many locals and tourists of other hotels are here for some breakfast, juice and coffee. Also the friendy owner is a big help in finding the nice places to go. The free WiFi works perfect since there are 2 access points now.","July 27, 2011","31    Morrisson Hotel

1557,"We stayed at Morrisson Exclusive Rooms for only 3 nights. We had a business meeting and Morrisson Hotel was closest to our point of interest. Reading the comments we were a little skeptical about the hotel, but everything proved to be contrary to the defamatory review. So trust us and give credit to the positive ones! As soon as we arrived we were greeted with respect and professionalism by the staff members. At the reception we were given all the details we needed; starting with the breakfast (the location of the bar, what will be served for breakfast and scheduling) and a detailed guided tour on the map of all the sights we could visit in the short time we had free after working. We liked that very much! Moreover we received complex answers to all our questions and they helped us with everything we needed (and we had a lot to ask..). Comments complaining of lack of professionalism, lack of cleanliness and lack of respect of the staff, from our point of view are pure evil. The rooms were more than impeccable; every day I felt like we only just arrived, because the rooms were as clean and neatly arranged as on the day we checked in. Breakfast, though in a bar a few minutes away from the hotel, delighted us. We presented the coupons we received every morning, in the hotel, to the cashier and we were friendly served with delicious croissants of different tastes and quality coffee. Our room 403 was gorgeous! We were worried though, about the Wi Fi signal after reading here that it would be weak, but we were assured that it will perfectly work, because the signal was strengthened in all rooms, and so it was. It worked great!We will come back for sure, because we were excited about how we were treated! We did not find anything at this hotel that we do not like.I'm glad we did not let the negative review scare us away and tested on our own the hospitality of this hotel! The hotel should be rated as a five stars hotel!!","July 1, 2011","31    Morrisson Hotel
